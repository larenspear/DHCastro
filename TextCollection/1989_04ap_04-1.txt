[Text] Mikhail Gorbachev, general secretary of the CPSU Central Committee
and president of the Presidium of the USSR Supreme Soviet, paid a visit
this morning to La Guinera neighborhood, accompanied by Commander in Chief
Fidel Castro.  A multitude of people, with notable participation of
pioneers,was concentrated along the motorcade route followed by Gorbachev,
Fidel, and the rest of the delegation visiting us, to cheer the Soviet and
Cuban peoples and reaffirm the friendship between the fatherlands of Lenin
and Marti.

A lively chat took place between the visitors and residents and
construction workers in La Guinera, where commander in chief also explained
to Gorbachev the work method used for the construction of the community and
the elimination of various unhealthy neighborhoods in Havana

[Begin recording] [Castro] Are you already organized?  In how many
neighborhoods (?are you working?)

[Unidentified speaker] [Words indistinct]

[Castro] In four neighborhoods.  How many apartments do you have to build?

[Speaker] Here we have to build from 900 to 1,000 apartments.

[Castro] You will have to pay something after you finish the buildings.

[Speaker] We have to pay a percentage of the housing.

[Castro] A percentage.

[Speaker] In addition to building...

[Castro, interrupting] Do you become owners of the housing units?

[Speaker] We become owners of the housing units.

[Gorbachev, in Russian with simultaneous Spanish translation] We wish to
all of you that you continue building very well and that you can solve your
housing problem as soon as possible and that you build well [repeats].

At the end of the tour, the residents of the neighborhood presented a
bouquet of flowers to Raisa Gorbachev, wife of the highest Soviet leader
and gave Gorbachev an album with photographs of minibrigade members
participating in the construction of buildings for new families in La
Guinera.
