FL310052 Havana Domestic Service in Spanish 0000 GMT 31 Oct 84

[Text] In spite of the Reagan administration forcing us to prepare
ourselves militarily and to divert resources for defense, Cuba's economy
has grown 9.8 percent this year. This statement was made by Commander in
Chief Fidel Castro on speaking at the 39th CEMA meeting being held at the
Palace of Conventions.

Fidel said that our relations with capitalist nations are structured by the
sharp price decreases in sugar and nickel. Therefore, only the fact that
Cuba belongs to the socialist community, along with the creative work of
its people, has allowed the country to advance.

Castro reiterated that Cuba's economic successes have been guaranteed
without dropping its internationalist obligations toward a group of nations
in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, especially in Nicaragua and Angola.

The Cuban leader said that if the world, with the socialist countries in
the forefront, is able to reject, as we believe it will, the Reagan
administration's senseless positions, which lead to nuclear devastation,
the prepared development plans to the year 2000 will be implemented.
