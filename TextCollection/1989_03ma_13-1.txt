[Text] Commander in Chief Fidel Castro Ruz toured Pinar del Rio Province
last Saturday [11 March].  He went to several production, social, and
health centers, among others.

Fidel praised the application of science and technology in rice harvesting
in the westernmost province of the country.  This will double yields and
save almost half of the amount of water.  Touring several Pinar del Rio
areas, the chief of the revolution gave special attention to the terraces
being built in the rice fields.  This method will allow total mechanization
of irrigation systems and will make the work of farmers more humane.

He explained that some 300 hectares with 1 million cubic meters of soil are
being worked on at this time.  Some 130 million need to be moved.  First,
the organic layer is removed, then the clay is leveled; and later, the
organic layer is put back.  This will result in a gigantic field from
Havana and Pinar del Rio.  Rice harvesting is rotated with tomatoes and
beans.

Fidel also visited the provincial capital's multiple-use building that is
about to be completed.  It has room for 3,000 spectators and 16 sport
disciplines can be practiced simultaneously.
