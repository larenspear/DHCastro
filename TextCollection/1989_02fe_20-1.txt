[Text] Fidel Castro, president of the Councils of State and Ministers, has
received Mr (Jose A. Cerro), executive secretary of the Group of Latin
American and Caribbean Sugar Exporting Countries, GEPLACEA.  The two
official discussed views on the activities that this important group is
carrying out, especially the possibilities that exist in the
diversification of the industry and sugar agriculture and in the area of
genetic engineering and biotechnology.

The GEPLACEA executive secretary explained the work the group plans this
year and the topics that will be discussed during its plenary meeting,
which will be held in Guatemala in October.

Comrade Fidel explained the plans our country has for sugar development,
including diversification and the need for underdeveloped countries to make
joint efforts to defend their interests in this sector, especially in
obtaining fair prices for their export products.

The importance of agriculture and the sugar industry to the economies of
regional countries was noted, as was the role GEPLACEA plays in cooperation
and regional integration efforts and the need for an active presence on the
part of all members.

Foreign Trade Minister Ricardo Cabrisas and Eduardo [last name indistinct],
director of that organization [title as heard], also participated in the
meeting.
