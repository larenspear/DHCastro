CASTRO SPEAKS AT COOPERATIVE DEDICATION
(Editor's Note)  Premier Fidel Castro spoke for half an hour at the opening
of a cooperative in Camaguey on Sunday afternoon, Jan. 24.  The speech was
apparently carried only by Havana, CMBL, Voz del INRA, at 2030 GMT in a
special cast.  After reading a list of names of those who were to receive
homes at the cooperative, the premier told of the revolutionary goals,
including a raise in the standard of living and improvement in hygienic
conditions.  He said that "threats and insolence" from outside Cuba would
make Cubans and the revolution stronger.  "In handing over these homes
today bearing names of martyrs of the fatherland I wish to remind you that
we are working for justice," he concluded.
