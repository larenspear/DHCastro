[Text] Havana, 27 Jun (ANGOP) - San Nujoma, SWAPO's president, last Monday
accused South Africa and the United States of "maintaining the illegal
occupation of Namibia and trying to destablizate independent countries in
the region." At the meeting with Cuban President Fidel Castro in Havana,
the SWAPO leader reiterated that the resolution of the Namibian issue lies
in the implementation of the UN Security Council Resolution 435. In turn,
Fidel Castro reaffirmed the solidarity of Cuba with SWAPO's struggle for
Namibia's independence, and he recalled the Cuban-Angola declaration which
was adopted on 1 March on the occasion of the visit of Jose Eduardo dos
Santos, Angola's president, to Havana. According to a note issued in Havana
last Monday, Sam Nujoma informed Fidel Castro of the current situation of
Southern Africa. We recall that the Namibian leader arrived in Havana last
Wednesday at the invitation of Fidel Castro, the Cuban president.
