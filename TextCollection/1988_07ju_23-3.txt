[Text] Commander in Chief Fidel Castro toured the new cardiology center of
the Saturnino Lora clinical-surgical provincial hospital today around noon
as part of the program of visits and inaugurations he has been carrying
out in Santiago de Cuba Province since yesterday.  The modernization of the

services as computerized axial tomography equipment, extracorporeal
litholapaxy, and semi-hyperbaric chambers to serve the eastern provinces.

stands for revolution in all areas of medicine--medical equipment factory.
