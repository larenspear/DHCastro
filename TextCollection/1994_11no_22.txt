FL2311173494 Havana Tele Rebelde Network in Spanish 0144 GMT 22 Nov 94 FL2311173494 Havana Tele Rebelde Network Spanish BFN [Remarks by President Fidel Castro Ruz during the morning session of the First World Solidarity With Cuba Conference at Havana's Karl Marx Theater on 21 November -- recorded] 

[FBIS Translated Text] Solidarity and discipline are supposed to go hand in hand. [laughter] 

I will not give a speech following what Comrade Alarcon has said. I have nothing to say, nothing to add. His address was brilliant. [unidentified speaker calls for a greeting] 

A greeting? We have been greeting each other since we arrived here. We must allow the organizers to continue with the agenda. They are the ones who came up with the format for this meeting. Let us proceed now with a dialogue. We do not want this to become a succession of speeches. I thank you very much for your kindness and generosity and your request that I say a few words. I alone should not speak; many of us should speak, as well as you. If circumstances require, then any one of us will be happy to comply, clarifying whatever is unclear and participating in turn. I am a participant just like all of you. [crowd applauds, chants pro-Castro slogan]
