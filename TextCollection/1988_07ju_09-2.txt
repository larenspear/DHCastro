Meeting's 'Historic Aspect'

FL0907155588 Havana Television Service in Spanish 0000 GMT 9 Jul 88

[Text] At the conclusion of this newscast, our Commander in Chief Fidel
Castro, first secretary of the PCC Central Committee and president of the
Councils of State and Ministers, is at this moment closing the third
meeting of Havana enterprises.  We have portions of his speech for you.

[Begin Castro recording] Comrades, almost 20 hours ago... [corrects
himself] no, not almost 20 hours ago.  We have been meeting for almost 20
hours.  The topics discussed have been of much interest.  Of course, a
certain amount of exhaustion always sets in.  This is why it does not seem
convenient to use to prolong the meeting even though we know that we could
be holding discussions here for many days and we would still not have time
to discuss many things of great interest.
