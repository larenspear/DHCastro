HAVANA--PREMIER FIDEL CASTRO SAID TODAY THAT THE REVOLUTION MUST FINISH
ITS WORK BEFORE ANY ELECTIONS CAN BE HELD IN CUBA.
HE MADE HIS STATEMENT IN AN ADDRESS TO AN ESTIMATED 100,000 PERSONS IN
CAMAGUEY AT THE CLOSE OF THE FIRST PROVINCIAL CONGRESS OF FIELD WORKERS.
THE HUGE MULTITUDE JAMMING FINLAY SQUARE IN THE HEART OF CUBA'S CATTLE
RAISING INDUSTRY ROARED APPROVAL OF CASTRO'S REMARK THAT THE SIZE OF THE
MEETING "SHOULD FRIGHTEN COUNTER-REVOLUTIONARIES."

PRESIDENT MANUEL URRUTIA AND ERNESTO (CHE) GUEVARA, ONE OF CASTROS
CHIEF LIEUTENANTS DURING THE REVOLUTION, ALSO WERE AMONG THE PRINCIPAL
SPEAKERS.

THE CASTRO SPEECH HIGHLIGHTED THE INAUGURATION OF THE PEOPLE'S RICE
COOPERATIVE ON THE 26,800-ACRE FARMLANDS CONFISCATED FROM EX-SEN. GUILLERMO
AGUILERA.  CASTRO SAID THE NEW COOPERATIVE WILL FURNISH A LIVELIHOOD FOR
800 FAMILIES.  THE GOVERNMENT HAS DONATED 21 TRACTORS TO THE GROUP AND MADE
A ONE MILLION-PESO LOAN WITHOUT INTEREST FOR REPAYMENT OVER A FIVE-YEAR
PERIOD.

CASTRO SAID DURING HIS SPEECH THAT HE WAS NOT WORRIED ABOUT CRITICISM
FROM ABROAD.

"LET THEM WRITE WHAT THEY WANT TO AGAINST CUBA," HE SAID.  "LET THEM
WRITE AGAINST THE REVOLUTION.  WE KNOW WHY THEY WRITE.  BECAUSE IT (THE
REVOLUTION) IS JUST, BECAUSE IT WISHES TO PUT AN END TO EXPLOITATION AND
PRIVILEGE, BECAUSE IT DOES NOT STEAL, IT DOES NOT OPPRESS; BECAUSE IT DOES
NOT SURRENDER, DOES NOT BOW THE KNEE AND IS NOT FOR SALE; BECAUSE IT
DEFENDS THE SOVEREIGNTY AND DIGNITY OF THE NATION...

"THEY (THE CRITICS) DID NOT COMBAT TYRANNY NOR DENOUNCE THE CRIMES THE
BLOODY FOLLOWERS OF THE DICTATORSHIP NOR WRITE AGAINST THE DICTATOR.
BECAUSE THE DICTATOR (FULGENCIO BATISTA) WAS NOTHING MORE THAN A SERVENT OF
THE GREAT INTERESTS...

"WHO ARE THEY WHO PROTEST?  THEY ARE THOSE FOREIGN INTERESTS WHO HAD
WAR CRIMINALS AT THEIR SERVICE."

CASTRO RENEWED HIS CHARGES THAT HIS OPPONENTS ARE BUYING ARMS IN MIAMI
AND PREPARING CAMPAIGNS AGAINST HIM THERE.

"THEY ARE TRYING TO ISOLATE US FROM THE REST OF THE WORLD...THE GREAT
MONOPOLISTIC INTERESTS ASSOCIATED WITH WAR CRIMINALS, EMBEZZLERS AND AGENTS
OF (DOMINICAN STRONGMAN RAFAEL) TRUJILLO...THEY WANT TO SURROUND US WITH A
WALL OF INFAMY...SO THEY CAN RETURN TO CUBA...

"THEY'LL NEVER GET HERE SPREADING CALUMNIES ABROAD.  THEY CAN WRITE IN
MAGAZINES WHICH HAVE CIRCULATIONS OF THOUSANDS, THEY CAN SEND FALSE NEWS TO
ALL THE WORLD...THEY CAN NEVER FOOL CUBA...THEY'LL HAVE TO FIGHT THE
PEOPLE.

 MAGAZINE, U.S. NEWS AND WORLD REPORT SAID TODAY THAT
SIGNS ARE GROWING OF A DECLINE IN THE PUBLIC SUPPORT OF FIDEL CASTRO IN
CUBA.

IT SAID THAT A RECENT POLL OF PUBLIC OPINION INDICATED HIS POPULARITY
HAS DROPPED IN THREE MONTHS FROM APPROVAL BY MORE THAN 90 PERCENT OF THE
PEOPLE TO ONLY 52 PER CENT.

MANY CUBANS ARE BECOMING DISENCHANTED WITH HIS REGIME.  CRITICISM IS
BEGINNING TO ARRIVE.  ASSASSINATION PLOTS HAVE BEEN RUMORED IN RECENT
WEEKS."

THE MAGAZINE REPORTED THESE THINGS IN A COPYRIGHT ARTICLE COMPILED FROM
REPORTS IN HAVANA, WASHINGTON AND NEW YORK, IT SAID.

"LOOK UNDER THE SURFACE IN CUBA AND THE SIGHT IS NOT PRETTY," THE
MAGAZINE CONTINUED.

"EXECUTIONS ARE GOING ON, DAY AFTER DAY...NOW MORE THAN 500 CUBANS HAVE
BEEN SHOT BY FIRING SQUADS AFTER THE BRIEFEST OF MILITARY TRIALS.

"HABEAS CORPUS IS DENIED.  CIVIL COURTS ARE STILL NOT OPERATING THREE
MONTHS AFTER THE END OF THE REVOLUTION.

"AS HAPPENED UNDER BATISTA, PEOPLE AGAIN ARE BEING JAILED WITHOUT LEGAL
CHARGES.  MAIL IS INTERCEPTED AND OPENED.  TELEPHONE LINES ARE TAPPED,
INCLUDING THOSE OF THE U.S. EMBASSY.  NEWSPAPERS ARE UNDER A 'CENSORSHIP OF
FEAR.'

"ALREADY THERE ARE IN CUBA MANY OF THE TRAPPINGS OF A COMMUNIST STATE."

THE MAGAZINE ALSO PUBLISHED WHAT IT CLAIMED WAS A CONFIDENTIAL
INTELLIGENCE MEMORANDUM ON CASTRO AND THE PEOPLE AROUND HIM.

IT SAID "HE HATES THE UNITED STATES AND HAS BEEN A REVOLUTIONARY SINCE
HIGH-SCHOOL DAYS," ALTHOUGH IT SAID THAT THERE IS NOTHING TO INDICATE THAT
CASTRO HIMSELF IS OR HAS BEEN A COMMUNIST.

IT SAID HIS BROTHER, RAUL, IS A DEDICATED COMMUNIST AND "THE MOST
DANGEROUS OF THEM ALL."
