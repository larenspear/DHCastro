[FBIS Translated Text] The modern bicycle factory being built based on Chinese technology in Villa Clara Province has produced during the trial period approximately 5,000 bicycles similar to those imported from the Asian country. Although only model No. 26 for men and women has been manufactured so far, the assembly line of model No. 28 for men is expected to go into production in the coming weeks to meet a larger demand. 

A team of technicians and engineers from the PRC is providing advice on the construction of this factory, 92 percent of which has been completed: 

[Begin unidentified speaker recording] We can say we have received excellent cooperation from the Cuban counterpart from the beginning up to today, and all comrades working here are satisfied with the attention and working behavior demonstrated by the Cuban staff. 

We are far from our fatherland, China, and our relatives, but we feel as if we were still home. [end recording] 

When the construction of this Chinese technology factory is finally concluded, approximately 150,000 bicycles, basically destined for the domestic market, will be manufactured here annually.
