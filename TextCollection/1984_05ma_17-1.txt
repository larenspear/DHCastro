[Text] Havana, 17 May (ADN) -- The steady and dynamic development of
relations between the GDR and Cuba are playing an important role in
preserving and securing peace in view of the immediate imperialist threat.
This was said by Cuban state and party leader Fidel Castro and GDR Deputy
Chairman Gerhard Weiss during a talk in Havana Wednesday. Weiss is leading
a delegation to the 12th meeting of the GDR-Cuba Economic Commission.

Both sides agreed that economic cooperation between the two countries in
accordance with bilateral agreements and multilateral agreements within
CEMA has great benefit for the national economies of the two countries and
for the further industrialization of Cuba. Fidel Castro stressed the
significance of economic cooperation with other socialist countries,
especially the GDR and the USSR, in view of the imperialist embargo. He
emphasized the need for long-term planning and coordination in cooperation
between the CEMA countries in all central states of the economy as well as
in science and technology.

Also on Wednesday, the GDR deputy chairman opened an exhibition about the
Cuban ceramics industry on the Island of Youth, in the development of which
the GDR played a central part.
