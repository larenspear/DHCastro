FL041321 Havana Radio Progreso Network in Spanish 1246 GMT 4 Apr 87

[Text] At the conclusion of last night's session at 2000 [0000 GMT, 4
April], our Commander in Chief Fidel Castro praised the work carried out at
the Fifth UJC Congress.

[Begin Castro recording] There are topics that have not been discussed and
there seem to be many. Our discussions have been proceeding well. There
have been interesting topics, which is why there have been delays. The
comrades can have little doubt that the immense majority of things said
here have been very interesting to the youth, country, and the revolution.
Many points have been made.

There are also delegates who have not yet spoken. We should not be slaves
to time. We do not need to end this discussion today. If the discussions
continue to be good, there is no reason to cancel them. We can continue the
discussion tomorrow. I completely agree with this. [end recording]

The debate will continue today on education, the importance of political
and ideological work, and the role of culture in youth development.

The Fifth UJC Congress will conclude tomorrow.
-END-
