[FBIS Translated Text] [Sardina] During a conversation with reporters, Fidel gave his opinion of Cuban-Chinese relations. 

[Begin recording] [Castro] They could not be better. They are outstanding. 

[Sardina] What about prospects? 

[Castro] Even better. Everything is going well. I had a very pleasant time celebrating the 45th anniversary of such a momentous event. I was reminding the ambassador [Xu Yicong] that when I was a student -- around 1945, 1946, 1947 -- the PRC did not exist and we had here the [passage indistinct, 2 seconds] but the triumph of the revolution in China did not take much longer. Thus, the establishment and development of relations. Relations have progressed a great deal lately. Every ambassador has worked hard, particularly the current one. He has worked the hardest.

[Sardina] In response to a question about Cuba's economic future, Fidel expressed his optimism: 

[Begin recording] [Castro] We see a promising future. If we were not optimistic, we would not have a reason for being. A revolutionary has to be optimistic. Times have been hard and difficult, but no one hesitated to confront the times and have done so despite all the difficulties and hassle. We have no reason to be pessimistic. We have reasons to be optimistic. [end recording]
