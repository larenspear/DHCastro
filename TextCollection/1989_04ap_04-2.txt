[Text] Mikhail Gorbachev, general secretary of the CPSU Central Committee,
and Commander in Chief Fidel Castro are visiting this morning the La
Guinera neighborhood in this capital.

The highest Soviet leader and his delegation will be able to see in the
neighborhood of Arroyo Naranjo [Municipality] how the minibrigades have
changed the appearance of the area and how it continues to be transformed
every day.  In no other place could the strength of the minibrigade
movement be better appreciated--a movement that was revitalized in our
capital.  The movement permitted La Guinera neighborhood to rid itself of
unsanitary conditions, poverty, promiscuity, and negligence and turn it
into a new community.

The new scene that the Soviet visitors will be able to see today started 2
years ago with the construction of the first houses, and now there are
child care centers, family doctor clinics, and other social works.
