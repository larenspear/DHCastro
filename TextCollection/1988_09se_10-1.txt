[Text] Commander in Chief Fidel Castro yesterday met for more than 2 hours
with the Cuban baseball team, which recently returned from Italy.

Fidel expressed interest in events that occurred during the championship.
He was especially interested in the details of the two games played against
the United States.  Fidel had a lively discussion about this with Lourdes
Gurriel, undisputed hero to both games.

Fidel said:  I was always confident that we would be able to tie and win
those games because our ball players are truly great.

The commander in chief also stressed the skills of U.S. pitcher (Gene
Abus), especially his willingness and perseverance.  This is why the
victory is so great, he added, because the game was against a truly good
team.
