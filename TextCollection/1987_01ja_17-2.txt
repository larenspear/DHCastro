[TASS report:  "F. Castro Speech"]

[Text] Havana, 16 Jan -- Fidel Castro, first secretary of the Communist
Party of Cuba Central Committee and chairman of the republic's Councils of
State and Ministers, sharply condemned the U.S. militarist aggressive
course in a speech at the Eighth Congress of the Latin American Continental
Organization of Students, being held here.

The speaker dwelled in detail on U.S. relations with Latin American
countries and the growing contradictions between them stemming from the
Washington Administration's imperial selfish policy. The enslavement of the
continent's countries by financial organizations, unequal trade, and
protectionism is a tangible manifestation of this policy.

The Latin American peoples, F. Castro went on, desire independence and
freedom. Their contradictions with imperialism are becoming increasingly
acute and deep. Cuba does not claim the role of liberator of the whole of
Latin America and the Caribbean. But the Cuban revolution has always played
an important role in the continent's history. Moreover, Latin America
became considerably more independent following its victory. Cuba's example
in resisting imperialist blockade and its revolutionary struggle have
affected the growth of the entire region's political maturity.

The Cuban leader went on to dwell on the course of the struggle against
errors and negative trends. He called for the elimination of everything
that hinders the best possible utilization of resources and successful
advancement.
