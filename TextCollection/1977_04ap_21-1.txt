to Cuba it would be improper for his government to create obstacles.  The
Cuban leader [word indistinct] that tourist trips would be facilitated.

Castro added:  "Our conviction is that there are interesting prospects for
developing U.S.-Cuban trade.  If solid and stable bases are established
after the lifting of the embargo, we could change the orientation of our
agricultural policy and our production plans with a view toward obtaining
technology, equipment, raw materials and other products from the United
States."

Castro personally visited the American businessmen at their hotel, 30
minutes away from Havana.  In an unprecedented move for this type of
