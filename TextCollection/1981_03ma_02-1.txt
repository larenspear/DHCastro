FL022005 Havana Domestic Service in Spanish 1800 GMT 2 Mar 81

[Excerpt] Commander in Chief Fidel Castro, first secretary of the Cuban
Communist Party [PCC] Central Committee and president of the councils of
State and Ministers, has visited the port of Ilishevo, some 20 km from the
Soviet city of Odessa. The Cuban leader is visiting Odessa accompanied by
other members of our party's delegation to the highest meeting of the
Soviet communists. The program of activities also includes visits to the
Museum of Combative Glory and the city's catacombs which extend hundreds of
kilometers at a depth of from 15 to 50 meters underground.

Before a large group of workers and after being greeted by the chief of the
port of Ilishevo, Fidel expressed gratitude for the welcome and for the
opportunity to observe the modern port facilities. He said that more than 1
million tons of goods are moved through that port to Cuba and that Ilishevo
is a symbol of the Cuban-Soviet friendship. He conveyed to the workers of
that Soviet port on the Black Sea greetings from the Cuban people and,
especially from our port workers. Immediately afterward, he boarded a
launch and toured the port which, inaugurated in 1958, today is one of the
biggest in the USSR.
