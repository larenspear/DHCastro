[Summary] Dresden--Escorted by thousands of Dresden workers, Latin American
students and vacationers, the Cuban party and government delegation
strolled through the streets of Dresden, accompanied by SED Polithuro
members Werner Lamberz and Werner Krolikowski. Fidel Castro left the Neva
Hotel to the sounds of the Cuban Revolutionary March. Streetcars and buses
stopped and FDJ and Young Pioneers bands played the fighting songs of the
international working class and Cuban rhythms.
