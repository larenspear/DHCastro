[Text] Havana (ADN) -- Fidel Castro, first secretary of the Cuban Community
Party and chairman of the Councils of State and Ministers, received on
Tuesday [15 May] GDR Construction Minister Wolfgang Junker who is staying
in Havana for the 57th session of the permanent CEMA commission for the
building industry. Minister Junker conveyed greetings from Erich Honecker,
general secretary of the SED Central Committee and chairman of the GDR
State Council, to which Fidel Castro most cordially reciprocated.

Problems of cooperation in the building industry sector were discussed
during the talks, which took place in a friendly, cordial atmosphere. The
experiences in preparing and carrying out the long-term apartment building
program and particularly the architectural designing of the capital of
Berlin were explained to Fidel Castro. He underscored that despite the
tense political situation, particular attention is also being attached in
Cuba to solving the housing problem, particularly in Havana.

Fidel Castro highly valued the economic cooperation with the GDR and
particularly the promotion of the development of the Cuban cement industry
by the GDR. He stressed that it has been possible through GDR support to
steadily ensure supplies of cement to the Cuban construction industry in
the past few years.
