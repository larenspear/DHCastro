OAS ASSAILED BY CASTRO AS USELESS

Union Radio, Havana, in Spanish to Cuba, Jan. 25, 1959, 2330 GMT--E
(UNCLASSIFIED)

(Excerpts) Referring to inter-American politics and relations, Dr. Fidel
Castro complained in Caracas of the Organization of American States in
which, he said, there is no confidence because that organization has been
useless.  It is not possible, Fidel Castro stressed, for the
representatives of democratic Venezuela and Cuba to he listening to
speeches in which Trujillo speaks of freedom and human dignity.  Cuba is
determined to speak the truth at the OAS, and it would be (acceptable?) for
the democratic Latin American countries to propose to the OAS the necessity
of removing the representatives of the dictatorships or retire from that
organization.

Dr. Castro said that exiles from the Dominican Republic, Paraguay, and
Nicaragua can to to Cuba where they will be given housing, food and all
kinds of facilities because we know of the suffering that takes place
during the years of exile.

He declared that the Venezuelans would not need visas or passports to go to
Cuba and that the same should be done in Venezuela.  He added that it was
the only way to eliminate the barriers and restrictions that separate the
Latin American nations which should be more united now than ever.

The leader of the Cuban revolution added:  We have swept Cuba, or better,
we are sweeping away all vices and injustices, the crimes that were
committed and we are determined never again to permit a new dictatorship.
