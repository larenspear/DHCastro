[Text] Havana, 28 Jul (ADN) -- On behalf of Erich Honecker, general
secretary of the SED Central Committee and chairman of the GDR Council of
State, Guenter Mittag presented to Fidel Castro, first secretary of the
Cuban Communist Party Central Committee and president of the Cuban Councils
of State and of Ministers, a bust of Karl Marx as the official present from
the GDR on the occasion of the 30th anniversary of the attack on the
Moncada.

Fidel Castro thanked him for this present, which impressively affirms the
militant bond of our Marxist-Leninist parties. He asked Guenter Mittag to
convey his thanks and high appreciation to Erich Honecker and the creator
of the bust, the sculptor Fritz Cremer. The Cuban Communists are pleased
with this present and, as Fidel Castro said, will choose a worthy place for
the bust.
