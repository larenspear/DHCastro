[Text] Speaking before the third national meeting of agricultural
cooperatives, President Fidel Castro urged all peasants to increase tobacco
production in the country.  This sector annually contributes more than $60
million to the country's economy.

This was the issue discussed Sunday during the 2d and last day of work of
the meeting being held at the Havana Palace of Conventions.  During the
meeting peasant leaders noted the role in the cooperatives of women, who
constitute approximately half of the labor force.

During a dialogue with the delegates attending the final meeting.  Castro
expressed the need to have Caujeri Valley, in eastern Guantanamo Province,
become an important source of vegetables throughout the year because of its
climatic characteristics.  Those attending the meeting agreed that
cooperatives should produce what people need, because this is the way
cooperatives will fulfill their social objective.
