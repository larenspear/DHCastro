FULL TEXT OF ARTICLE:
1.  [Excerpts] With the presence of Commander in Chief Fidel Castro, president
of the Councils of State and Ministers, and Army General Raul Castro, the
National Assembly of the People's Government has elected Comrade Juan Escalona
Reguera as president and Comrade Zoila Benitez de Mendoza for the post of vice
president.  [passage omitted]

2.  After the results were made known and received with lengthy applause, the
new leaders of the Cuban parliament took their seats, and Comrade Escalona
expressed to the plenary session his pledge to work hard to meet the goals and
defend the revolution and socialism. Following the president's words, Commander
in Chief Fidel Castro spoke, reiterating the need for unity to prevail in our
people and our party.

3.  [Begin Castro recording] We will not permit anything that damages in the
least this fundamental strength of the people. This is very clear. I think even
five year old children can understand this. I think that two and
three year olds can understand why we need unity, why we have a party.

4.  Now, among the advantages there are also disadvantages, and those
disadvantages are the ones we must know how to overcome in our rectification
process.  However, the solution must always be based on these principles. And
when you want to work....[changes thought] It is not new. I said it before the
Central Committee when we were analyzing the Politburo's proposals. Do not
think of spectacular things. Let us leave the spectacular things aside. Let us
do a lot; let us work a lot and promise little. [end recording]

5.  At this time our commander in chief is still speaking at the extraordinary
session of the National Assembly of the People's Government, which is being
held at the Palace of Conventions.
