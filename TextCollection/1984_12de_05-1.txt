LD051546 Moscow TASS in English 1457 GMT 5 Dec 84

[Text] Havana December 5 TASS -- First Secretary of the Central Committee
of the Communist Party of Cuba, chairman of the State Council and the
Council of Ministers of the Republic of Cuba Fidel Castro, speaking at the
closing meeting of the first national forum on questions of energetics,
pointed to the great importance that the development of all-round relations
with countries of the socialist community has for Cuba.

As a result of oil deliveries by the USSR, Cuba has become the only
developing state that was unaffected by the energy crisis in the years that
were most tragic in this respect for developing countries, Fidel Castro
said. At the same time, each of us give thought already now as to how the
energy program will be implemented in Cuba in future. The closest attention
must be given to the development of atomic power engineering.

Cuba's first atomic power station is now under construction in Cienfuegos.
Plans to build atomic power stations in the east of Cuba are being drawn
up. It will later be necessary to build another atomic power station in the
western part of the island.
