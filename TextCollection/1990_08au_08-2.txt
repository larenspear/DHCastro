1.  [Text] U.S. President George Bush today addressed the nation to officially
report the White House decision to send troops and war materiel to the Persian
Gulf under the pretext of preventing an Iraqi attack on Saudi Arabia.

2.  Bush asked the people of the United States to support the government's
decision to send a small fleet, which will consist of the 82nd Airborne
Division and several carriers, among other potent war materiel, to the region.

3.  The increase of the U.S. military presence in the Persian Gulf,
particularly within Saudi Arabian territory, further aggravates the explosive

of Kuwait.
