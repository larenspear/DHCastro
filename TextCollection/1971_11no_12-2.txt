morning at Antofagasta, Chile--recorded]

[Text] Civilian and military authorities, Chileans of Antofagasta
[cheers][: Once again we have been overcome with emotion too see our two
flags flying so near, so close to each other. (?In every sense I am filled)
with emotion over the affectionate reception [words indistinct] with which
you want to express your solidarity toward our country. I want to thank you
most sincerely.

I want to thank the mayor of Antofagasta. I want to say that it is [words
indistinct] a great honor for me to receive this title [of honorary citizen
of Antofagasta], [cheers], and these keys. I have also been deeply moved by
the words expressed by the representative of the people of Antofagasta.
Later today we will meet further with you at the university and a mass
meeting has also been scheduled. This is why I want to conclude by saying
that I will try to be a worthy son of Antofagasta. Thank you very much.
[applause, cheers]
