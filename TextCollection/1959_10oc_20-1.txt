PRIORITY

FIDEL CASTRO MADE UNSCHEDULED AND IMPROMPTU APPEARANCE BEFORE MEETING
FEDERATION BANK WORKERS NIGHT OCT 19. CARRIED OVER TV. FOLLOWING HIGHLIGHTS
BASED ON APPARENTLY CONFUSED AND POSSIBLY INCOMPLETE ACCOUNT IN 26 JULY
ORGAN REVOLUCION FOR OCT 20.

1)  CASTRO SAID CAMPAIGN IN CERTAIN PRESS ORGANS BOTH NATIONALLY AND
INTERNATIONALLY BEING FINANCED BY COUNTER-REVOLUTIONARIES AND INTERNATIONAL
CORPORATIONS. MENTIONED TIME, LIFE, WIRE SERVICES AND JULES DUBOIS, BUT
SAID UNNECESSARY NAME LOCAL PAPERS SINCE KNOWN TO PEOPLE. SAID CAMPAIGN
WOULD FAIL AS PEOPLE STOPPED BUYING PAPERS AND REACTED AGAINST COMPANIES
ADVERTISING IN THEM. ADDED THAT PEOPLES OF WORLD UNDERSTAND CUBAN
REVOLUTION IN SPITE OF INTERNATIONAL CAMPAIGN DEFAMATION, AND THAT IS WHAT
COUNTS.

2)  SAID THOSE WHO CALL FOR ELECTIONS ARE COUNTER-REVOLUTIONARIES AND
PROFESSIONAL POLITICIANS, INTERESTED IN DELAYING AND BLOCKING REVOLUTION.
ONLY THE VOICE OF THE PEOPLE NOW COUNTS IN CUBA, AND REVOLUTION WILL DO
ONLY WHAT THEY WANT. GOVT WILL FIRST SOLVE PROBLEMS OF REVOLUTION, AND
POLITICS WILL COME AFTERWARDS. TRUE DEMOCRATS, AND ESPECIALLY TRUE
CHRISTIANS, SHOULD RATHER SHARE THEIR POSSESSIONS WITH THEIR NEIGHBORS.
THOSE WHO ADVOCATE POLITICS WILL FIND OUT WHAT THE PEOPLE WANT. (THERE WERE
SHOUTS OF "FIDEL, FIDEL"). "NOT ONLY FIDEL, BUT ALSO RAUL, CHE, CAMILO AND
A LEGION MORE TO INSURE THAT WHATEVER HAPPENS OUR WORK WILL GO ON."

3)  SAID PEOPLE HAVE REACTED TO DIVISIONARY ATTEMPTS OF ENEMIES WITH
INCREASED UNITY, AND ATTACKS HENCE BECOMING DAILY MORE SHAMELESS AND
PROVOCATIVE. PEOPLE WILL DEFEND NATION INCH BY INCH TREE BY TREE. WHATEVER
THE STRENGTH OF ENEMY, HE WILL HAVE TO FIGHT US AND PAY BLOODILY FOR EVERY
SQUARE INCH. THOSE WHO HOPE TO DEFEAT REVOLUTION BY ECONOMIC STRANGULATION
OR INVASION ARE MINORITY GROUPS, WHO KNOW THEY LACK FOLLOWING INTERNALLY
AND PIN HOPES ON FOREIGH ELEMENTS. SINCE WE A DETERMINED PEOPLE, WE NOT
CONCERNED OVER MORE OR LESS SABOTAGE, MORE OR LESS AIRCRAFT. WHEN WE
STARTED STRUGGLE WE HAD NO AVIATION. AND IF WE DON'T HAVE AVIATION NOW, WE
HAVE BEST INFANTRY IN WORLD. AND WE HAVE THE CAMPESINOS AND WORKERS AND A
VALIANT PEOPLE. "THE BOMBS AND ARMS WHICH DESTROYED CUBAN CITIES AND
ATTACKED CUBAN PEOPLE CAME FROM THOSE WHO NOW PREOCCUPIED TO SEE THAT WE
LACK AVIATION. AND WE SAY TO THOSE WHO NOW THREATEN NOT TO BUY OUR PRODUCTS
THAT WHILE THERE IS LAND THERE IS FOOD AND THAT WE WILL TRAFFIC WITH ENTIRE
WORLD, WITHOUT NECESSITY OF DEPENDING ON SINGLE PRODUCT. WE WILL DEVELOP
ALL ECONOMIC POSSIBILITIES AND SELL OUR PRODUCTS IN ALL THE CORNERS OF THE
WORLD. IT IS THE LAST STRAW WHEN THEY WANT A PEOPLE NOT TO HAVE RELATIONS
WITH THE REST OF THE WORLD AND ON TOP OF THAT THREATEN NOT TO BUY WHAT IT
PRODUCES."

4)  SAID CAMPAIGN AGAINST REVOLUTION CAUSING PEOPLE TO OPEN EYES.
REVOLUTION HAS DONE MANY GREAT THINGS FOR THEM. BUT FOREIGNERS NOT
INTERESTED IN THAT, AND ATTACK CUBA WHEN EXISTING INTERESTS AFFECTED. "FOR
THEM TRUJILLO IS A GOOD GUY, BECAUSE ALTHO HE ROBS AND KILLS HE DOES NOT
AFFECT ANYBODY'S EXISTING INTERESTS. SO THEY DON'T CUT HIS SUGAR QUOTA."

5)  SAID REVOLUTION MUST ORGANIZE AND CONSOLIDATE AS IT ADVANCES. GOVT WILL
DEVELOP SOLID OPINION IN EACH WORKERS FEDERATION, MAKING THEM ARMIES OF
REVOLUTION. WILL DO SAME WITH CAMPESINOS THRU DEVELOPMENT ZONES.

6)  MAINTAINED GOVT DETERMINED TO DEVELOP TOURISM RAPIDLY AS POSSIBLE.
INTERNAL TOURISM FIRST, SO THAT CUBANS WILL NOT TRAVEL ABROAD AND WASTE
FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS IN EXCHANGE. THE INTERNATIONAL TOURISM, WHICH NOT
SUBJECT TO QUOTA. REVOLUTION MUST OBTAIN SUPPORT OF PEOPLES OF HEMISPHERE,
PARTICULARLY BECAUSE OF CAMPAIGN OF REACTIONARY PUBLICATIONS. PEOPLES CAN
HELP MUCH IN VISITING US. "WE SHOULD MAINTAIN FRIENDLIEST RELATIONS WITH
PEOPLE OF UNITED STATES.

THEY ARE SENSIBLE LIKE US. WE CAN DO MUCH THRU THEIR WORKING CLASSES. AND
THE AMERICAN WORKERS CAN SPEND A MONTH IN CUBA LIKE MILLIONAIRES. THE
REVOLUTION SHOULD TRY TO GAIN THE SYMPATHY AND ESTABLISH COMMERCIAL
RELATIONS WITH ALL THE PEOPLES OF THE WORLD. THERE ARE SEVERAL
PUBLICATIONS, LIKE TIME, LIFE, ETC., WHICH TRY TO GAIN US THE HATE OF THE
AMERICAN PEOPLE. THEREFORE, IT IS IMPORTANT TO TREAT TOURISTS WELL AND WIN
FRIENDS. THE NATURAL ALIES OF A PEOPLE ARE OTHER PEOPLES AND NOT PRIVILEGED
GROUPS. WE MUST BE CLEAR AND NOT BLAME THE AMERICAN PEOPLE FOR THE
INTERFERENCES OF THOSE GROUPS IN OUR AFFAIRS."
