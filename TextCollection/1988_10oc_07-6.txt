[Text] During the inauguration of three important social projects in
Havana, Commander in Chief Fidel Castro, first secretary of the PCC Central
Committee, dedicated most of his speech to praising the work carried out by
health workers, especially those from the William Soler cardiology center.
He said the workers were committed to turning the center into not only the
biggest but the best such center in the world.

[Begin Castro recording] There are certain circumstances that favor this.
It is not a matter of us being more intelligent than others or that we are
olympic champions of pediatric cardiovascular surgery.  No, it is not that.
But it is logical.  A hospital that has 50 or 100 surgery cases a year does
not have the same experience as one that performs 500, 1,000, or 1,200
surgeries a year.

In my conversations with the doctors of this center I have been able to see
how much experience counts.  Sometimes they have new or unusual cases.
They discover the way to solve them, the adequate medication to give after
surgery.  One can see what the accumulated experience can do, because
immediately after a similar case arrives, it is no longer new.  Those
illnesses are very complex.  Sometimes they are very complicated.  So, the
next case is no longer new.  Before long, they have resolved 50 cases of
that kind.  They start accumulating experience.  The experience accumulated
in 1,000 surgeries a year--anyone can understand this--is much greater than
the experience accumulated in performing 50 or 100 surgeries a year.
Having more than 1,000 cases a year is not the same as having 100 cases a
year.

Based on this, we believe that the cardiology center located precisely in
this municipality is going to be not only the biggest but the best
institution of its kind in the world.  [end recording]
