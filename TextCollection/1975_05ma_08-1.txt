[Text] Havana, 7 May--Prime Minister Fidel Castro today accompanies U.S.
Senator George McGovern on a tour through the valley of Picaduras, 60 km
southeast of this capital.

Fidel Castro told McGovern about the work being carried out in Cuba's
livestock sector, especially the genetics project in the Picaduras area.
Ramon Castro, a brother of the Cuban prime minister and director of the
plan, was present during the visit by McGovern and his retinue.

Back in Havana, the visitors made an unscheduled stop at a rural housing
project 60 km east of Havana, where they visited the homes of two peasant
families. The delegation later visited the Havana Club Rum Factory in Santa
Cruz del Norte east of Havana.

The prime minister explained the rum preparation process to the visitors
and offered a sample to Mr and Mrs McGovern and to the journalists.

The Democratic senator, a member of the U.S. Senate's Foreign Relations
Committee, also visited the Jose Marti (formerly Antillana) iron factory
today. The director of the factory, Juan Sanchez, explained how the factory
was paralyzed as a result of the U.S. blockade and how thanks to agreements
signed with the Soviet Union it has increased production tenfold since
1960.

McGovern, his wife Eleanor, and a small number of U.S. officials arrived in
Havana on Monday on a special flight from the United States.
