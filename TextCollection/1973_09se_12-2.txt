[Reply speech by Cuban Premier Fidel Castro at the 12 September welcoming
ceremony for the Cuban party and government delegation at the guest house
in Hanoi--recorded in Spanish, fading into Vietnamese translation]

[Text] We notice in Vietnam an extraordinary revolutionary spirit that
cannot be found in any other countries in the present era. Therefore, we
came from Cuba-- which is geographically a long way from Vietnam, but very
close to Vietnam sentimentally, ideologically and in aspirations--for a
visit to your country. [applause] And we are still very much moved by the
feelings we are experiencing this morning during our visit to Vietnam and
the Vietnamese people. [applause]

We are very much touched by the manifestation of sentiment, love and
hospitality by you comrades and the Vietnamese people. Therefore we [words
indistinct] in remembrance of your visit. [applause]

On behalf of the people, the Revolutionary Government, and the Communist
Party of Cuba, and on behalf of other delegation members, I express to you
comrades our feelings and gratitude. May I propose a toast to your
successes and the everlasting friendship between our two peoples.
