[Text] Berlin--While flying over the GDR state border with the CSSR, Fidel
Castro, secretary of the Cuban Communist Party Central Committee and Cuban
premier, sent a state cable to Erich Honecker, SED Central Committee first
secretary, and to Willi Stoph, chairman of the GDR Council of Ministers.
Castro expressed thanks for the outstanding tokens of fighting solidarity,
for the cordial and sincere hospitality experienced.

He was most impressed by the solidarity, the internationalist awareness,
and the anti-imperialist attitude which determined everywhere the
ideological attitude of the working people in the GDR.

The cable continues: "Proceeding from the ruins left the fascism in the
present territory of the GDR, a task of such material and moral dimensions
could only be realized in such a short time through socialism. All this is
the fruit of a wise and systematic political leadership by the SED, which
continues with dignity the best traditions of the German proletariat of
Karl Liebknecht, Rosa Luxemburg, and Ernst Thaelmann in the country in
which the brilliant creators of scientific socialism--Karl Marx and
Friedrich Engels--were born. It is also the fruit of the valuable
solidarity rendered by the Soviet Union.

"We are moved by the farewell from all those who are standing on the
dividing line between socialism and capitalism in Europe. We wish to
express our admiration to them for their achievements and to assure them of
our fighting solidarity and unbreakable fraternal friendship."
