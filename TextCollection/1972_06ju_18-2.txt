[Text] Rostock--The Cuban party-government delegation led by Fidel Castro,
first secretary of the Cuban Communist Party Central Committee and Cuban
premier, ended its 2-day stay in Rostock Bezirk Saturday evening and
returned by air to Berlin. During a farewell ceremony, Harry Tisch,
candidate member of the SED Central Committee Politburo and first secretary
of Rostock Bezirk SED Executive, and Fidel Castro exchanged cordial words.

Harry Tisch said that the people of the GDR and Cuba are united by the
joint anti-imperialist struggle, by membership in the socialist community
led by the Soviet Union, and by solidarity with the brave Vietnamese
people.

Castro replied that the delegation's visit to the GDR marks a new stage in
the development of relations between the two countries. "We will continue
to work in this spirit," he said, adding: "We were received everywhere by
the GDR people with great friendship and love. This reflects the
internationalists' awareness of the GDR people developed during years of
hard struggle."
