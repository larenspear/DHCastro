1.  [Text] We cannot just stand idly by and ignore our difficulties. Instead,
we must simply confront them, regardless of what they are.

2.  That is the headline of an interview granted by Commander in Chief Fidel
Castro to the GRANMA newspaper. The main topic of the interview published today
by the organ of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Cuba is the
strategy that will be applied to produce no less than 15 million quintals of
tubers and crops in Havana.

3.  In this regard, Fidel refers to three meetings of the Executive Committee
of the Council of Ministers to analyze and draft the guidelines. Another topic
discussed during the interview with the commander in chief pertains to the
introduction of the microject-air irrigation technology. Fidel also said that
the mobilization of Havana residents into agricultural tasks could be increased
to 20,000 workers during times of maximum demand.

4.  During the interview, Fidel reported that 100,000 bulls are being trained
for agricultural use. This step will not affect meat quotas, he said, because
poultry is supplying the amount of meat needed.

5.  In another part of the GRANMA interview, our commander in chief stressed
that if we have a surplus of personnel and not enough for them to do, the
revolution will never put a single man or woman out on the street.
