[Text] I remind you that you cannot exchange homes in isolated areas that
are linked to work centers because those houses are for the workers in the
area; they are not to be swapped, reiterated Commander in Chief Fidel
Castro who discussed this topic today at the third meeting of enterprises
that continues in this capital.

He stressed that there is a lack of concern for keeping those houses linked
to the jobs [vinculadas] and he said that this has happened in several
towns.  This occurred with (Balance) Spinning Mill houses in Wajay in the
Abel Santamaria neighborhood.  Someone even had a house there that he only
used on weekends.
