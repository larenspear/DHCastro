Cuba: Castro Asks To Sign Document on Code of Ethics 
PA1907035496 Havana Tele Rebelde and Cubavision Networks in Spanish, 0117 GMT 18 Jul 96 PA1907035496 Havana Tele Rebelde and Cubavision Networks Spanish BFN [Speech by President Fidel Castro Ruz at the ceremony during which the Code of Ethics of the Cuban state cadres was signed; place, date not given; from the "NTV" newscast -- recorded] 

[FBIS Translated Text] Comrades: Having to hear another speech was not in the program, but I want to explain and request something. I can speak louder. I think I am a little too far from the microphone. As I said, I was not supposed to deliver another speech, nor is it my intention, but I want to explain and request something. 

The comrades who have organized this activity, who in general have worked for a long time in the drafting and carrying out of a collective analysis of the code apparently felt it was not necessary to include us in the list of signatories. Perhaps they took into consideration the fact that Raul and I would be receiving this code with the signatures. Perhaps they also took into consideration our long history of revolutionary struggle during which we have been guided invariably by political, revolutionary, and ethical principles. We feel sad, however, not to see our names in this historical document; therefore, Raul and I, as high officials of the state administration, both request the honor of also signing it. [applause]
