[Excerpts] In his remarks to Cuban newsman, Fidel said that when he returns
from his trip to Chile he will give his impressions of the fraternal
Chilean people to our people and he told newsmen that they can get some
questions ready for that time.

Before he took off for Chile, Maj Fidel Castro referred to the forthcoming
amateur baseball world series that is to be played in our country. Fidel
said he was sorry that he could not be here for the beginning of the
series. I think that it will be a great series in spite of the obvious
intention of the United States to sabotage it, the prime minister
emphasized.

He added that one of the things claimed by the Yankees is that they did not
have money to go to the series. They could not come up with anything else
but in any case, it will be a good series. It has stirred up a lot of
excitement, Fidel said.

Referring to the coincidence of his trip to Chile with the baseball series,
Fidel stressed: "I for one am sorry, for the athletes' sake and for the
series but for the most part I am glad to make the trip."

[The amateur baseball world series in question is slated to begin on 21
November.]
