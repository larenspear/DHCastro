SIERRA MAESTRA TEACHERS RALLY NO. 7.

FIDEL CASTRO SPEECH (CONTINUED)

CUBA WAS ONE OF MANY LA NATIONS SUBJECTED BY IMPERIALISM. AND CUBA LAUNCHED
REBELLION OF AMERICA AGAINST YANKEE IMPERIALISM (CROWD CHANTS SLOGANS 3
MINUTES).  WE CUBANS KNOW WHAT WE ARE DOING.  THIS IS HISTORIC MOMENT FOR
OUR COUNTRY.  WE MUST RISE TO THE OCCASION AND MARCH FORWARD, CHOOSING
CAREFULLY OUR ROAD.  THOSE WHO DO NOT UNDERSTAND ARE THOSE WHO HAVE CHOSEN
WRONG ROADS.  CERTAIN ERRONEOUS EUPHORIA HAD BEEN CREATED.  IN SOME CASES
EVEN OUR REVOLUTIONARY PRESS MADE MISTAKE AND CONTRIBUTED TO EUPHORIA.
WHEN ALL ALONG REVOLUTIONARY GOVERNMENT HAS SAID 'WHAT CAN BE EXPECTED OF
OAS?'  CAN WE EXPECT FOREIGN MINISTER TO JOIN IN REVOLUTION AGAINST
IMPERIALISM?  NO, OF COURSE NO.  OLIGARCHIES, BOTH MILITARY AND ECONOMIC,
RULE IN OUR SISTER REPUBLICS.  CONSERVATIVE FORCES WILL NOT REBEL AGAINST
YANKEES.  WHAT GOVERNMENT IN PAST HAS SAID NO WHEN YANKEES SAID YES?  WHAT
GOVERNMENT HAS REFUSED RECEIVE ORDERS FROM WASHINGTON OR FROM YANKEE
EMBASSY.  WE ALL KNOW OF PAST HISTORY.  WE ALL KNOW HOW THEY TREMBLED WHEN
YANKEE AMBASSADOR SPOKE, BUT DIPLOMATIC REPRESENTATIVE OF OUR REVOLUTION
STOOD UP TO YANKEE FOREIGN MINISTER IN OAS.  OTHER LATIN AMERICAN FOREIGN
MINISTERS WERE DOCILE, OBEDIENT AND FOLLOWED ORDERS OF WASHINGTON AS
ALWAYS.  WE HAVE WITH US TONIGHT ONE LATIN AMERICAN GOVERNMENT LEADER WHO
TRIED TO STAND UP TO YANKEES AND WAS SLAPPED DOWN BY MILITARY CASTES.
(PICTURE SHIFTS TO ARBENZ)

LATIN AMERICAN FOREIGN MINISTERS SHOULD BE SAD AND FILLED WITH SHAME.
FIRST CASE OF GUATEMALA AND NOW CONFERENCE AT SAN JOSE.  THEY HAVE BETRAYED
PEOPLE OF A BROTHER NATION, A LATIN AMERICAN NATION VICTIMIZED BY LARGE
NEIGHBOR.  THEY HAVE PUT THEMSELVES ON SIDE OF POWERFUL YANKEES.  DID NOT
TAKE SIDE OF OUR SMALL BUT HEROIC NATION.  NO, MILITARY CASTES, LAWYERS FOR
MONOPOLIES, THOSE ON SIDE OF EXPLOITATION HAVE NOT TAKEN SIDE OF CUBAN
CAMPESINO AND WORKER TRYING TO CARRY OUR AGRARIAN REFORM.  THESE PRIVILEGED
CLASSES ARE ON SIDE OF THE COUNTRY WHICH EXPLOITS US AND WHICH PROTECTS
MOST REACTIONARY REGIMES IN WORLD TODAY.  EVEN THOUGH SOME FOREIGN
MINISTERS WERE IN SYMPATHY WITH US THEY RECEIVED ORDERS FROM THEIR
GOVERNMENTS AFTER STATE DEPARTMENT PUT ON PRESSURE.  (CASTRO HAS NOW BEEN
SPEAKING TWO HOURS).
