Nov 71 C--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY

[Text] Puerto Montt, Chile, 18 Nov--Cuban Prime Minister Fidel Castro began
to speak to the crowd gathering along the seaside avenue of this port at
2345 GMT with President Allende at his side. He had just met Allende for
the first time since beginning his 7-day trip through the interior of the
country.

He began his speech recalling the places visited during the 7 days of his
trip through the northern and southern parts of Chile. He then emphasized
the feeling of solidarity and friendship between the two countries.

The Cuban Prime Minister ended his speech to the huge popular gathering
saying that this mass event was especially honored by the presence of
Chilean President Salvador Allende. The Cuban leader added that "this is a
reason for happiness for the Chilean and Cuban people." These last words
were drowned out by the clamor or the crowd.

Maj Fidel Castro spoke for 20 minutes but his words--transmitted to
Santiago, Chile, by a radio network--were inaudible to listeners in the
Chilean capital.
