FL161348 Havana Tele-Rebelde Network in Spanish 1200 GMT 16 Dec 85

[Text] Commander in Chief Fidel Castro Ruz made the closing remarks at the
Seventh International New Latin American Film Festival, which has ended
after 14 days in Havana and during which 400 films were shown at various
movie theaters.  Earlier the Coral Awards were conferred in several film
categories.  Fidel spoke about how Latin American cinema has been a victim
of imperialist rule for many years.  He noted the need to get to know
better African cinema and that of each country of our continent.

[Begin Castro recording]  Allow me to tell you that what we have seen
during this film festival is so encouraging, so stimulating, that more than
ever our belief is confirmed that we will not be culturally colonized
forever, we will not be dependent forever, we will not be exploited
forever, and that some day, [applause] sooner rather than later, our time
for freedom will come.  Thank you very much. [applause] [end recording]
