SIERRA MAESTRA TEACHERS RALLY NO. 5.

FIDEL CASTRO SPEECH (CONTINUED)

TODAY NATION COUNTS WITH ANOTHER DEDICATED GROUP OF TEACHERS.  WE ARE
CONTENT THAT PLAN IS GOING WELL AND WILL BE SUCCESS.  CAMPESINOS DESERVE
HELP WHICH REVOLUTIONARY GOVERNMENT IS NOW GIVING THEM.  THEY DID NOT HAVE
TEACHERS UNTIL REVOLUTION BEGAN SENDING THEM.  OUR GOAL IS THAT THERE SHALL
BE NO CORNER IN THE MOUNTAINS OF CUBA WITHOUT A TEACHER.  WE WILL SEND
TEACHERS INTO EVERY CORNER OF SIERRA MAESTRA.  INTO CORNERS WHERE THERE ARE
NO DOCTORS, NO AVENUES OR CINEMAS, ONLY BEAUTY OF NATURE AND NOBLE
CAMPESINO.  EACH PERSON YOU EDUCATE WILL GIVE YOU FEELING OF PRIDE.
CAMPESINOS NEED MANY THINGS, BUT TEACHERS ABOVE ALL. WITHIN FEW DAYS YOU
HERE TONIGHT WILL ARRIVE AT YOUR NEW POSTS AND CAMPESINOS WILL HAVE
TEACHERS.  IF THERE ARE NOT ENOUGH WE WILL SEND MORE.  IF ERRORS HAVE BEEN
MADE IN LOCATING SOME RURAL SCHOOLS THEY WILL BE CORRECTED IN TIME.  THERE
MAY BE INITIAL PROBLEMS WITH SUPPLIER BUT THEY CAN BE OVERCOME AND FULL
SUPPLIES WILL BE SENT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.  IMPORTANT THING IS TO ESTABLISH
SCHOOL AND SCHOOL WHICH IS A FORM OF COMMUNICATION BETWEEN TEACHER AND
STUDENT.  YOU MUST ALSO TEACH ADULTS. ILLITERACY IN MOUNTAINS REACHES 90
PERCENT.

SOME OF YOU, OF COURSE, NEED MORE TRAINING.  THERE ARE A FEW WHO ARE NOT
YET FULLY CAPABLE AND WHO MUST TAKE FURTHER COURSES.

WE MUST KEEP OURSELVES READY IN ORDER THAT WE CAN HELP IN EDUCATIONAL
EFFORT NOT ONLY IN OUR OWN COUNTRY, BUT ALSO IN OTHER LATIN AMERICAN
COUNTRIES AS WELL. SUCCESSES YOU HAVE WILL SERVE TO STIMULATE OTHERS.

CASTRO HAS NOW BEEN SPEAKING ONE HOUR.
