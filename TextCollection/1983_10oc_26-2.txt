Castro Statement Cited

LD2161153 Moscow TASS in English 1133 GMT 26 Oct 83

[Text] Havana October 26 TASS -- First Secretary of the Central Committee
of the Communist Party of Cuba, President of the State Council and Chairman
of the Council of Ministers of the Republic of Cuba Fidel Castro today made
a statement of the Communist Party and the Government of Cuba in connection
with the U.S. imperialist intervention in Grenada.

The document firmly denounces the U.S. criminal perfidious aggression
against one of the tiniest countries in the world -- Grenada. The document
gives a well-reasoned rebuff to actions unprecedented in the practice in
international relations on the part of the United States, which used crack
military units against the outnumbered civilian Cuban personnel who are
rendering disinterested internationalist aid to the people of Grenada.

The statement points to the falsity, cynicism and unprincipledness of the
stand of the American authorities towards Cuba and Grenada.

The Communist Party and the government emphasized once again that Cuba has
firmly adhered and adheres to the policy of absolute non-interference of
any form in internal affairs to other states, in this specific case -- into
Grenada's inter-party and inter-state affairs.

The responsibility for the aggression and its consequences is laid on
American imperialism and its flunkeys.

In conclusion the statement highly appreciates the heroism and courage of
Cuban internationalists in Grenada, who, on being suddenly attacked by
aggressors, courageously continue defending their principles and honor of
their motherland.
