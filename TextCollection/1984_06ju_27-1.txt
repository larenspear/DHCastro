[Text] Havana, June 27 TASS -- Talks between the First Secretary of the
Central Committee of the Communist Party of Cuba, chairman of the State
Council, and the Council of Ministers of the Republic of Cuba Fidel Castro
and prominent American public figure and politician Jesse Jackson seeking
presidential nomination from the Democratic Party were held in the Havana
Palace of the Revolution.

It was stressed at the press conference here that questions connected with
the normalization of Cuban-American relations and topical problems of the
international situation were discussed during the talks. The sides declared
in support of the efforts of the "Contadora Group" aimed at the quest of
peaceful ways of the settlement of the crisis in Central America. They
stressed that the problems of the region must be decided on the basis of
the respect for people's rights to self-determination and non-interference
in their internal affairs.

The present situation in Latin America is a result of the acute social and
economic problems and the appalling situation of broad masses of the
people, Fidel Castro said. We hold that the vast funds that are now spent
for military purposes can and must be used for the solution of problems of
the developing countries, the Cuban leader said. Nobody needs war, he said.
