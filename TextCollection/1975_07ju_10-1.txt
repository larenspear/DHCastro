Mexico City INFORMEX in Spanish 2201 GMT 10 Jul 75 LF

[Text] Havana, 10 Jul (INFORMEX)--Exonerating the late President John
Kennedy and his brothers Robert and Ted, Cuban Prime Minister Fidel Castro
today confirmed that the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) made numerous
attempts on his life. Castro--speaking to correspondents of the Western
press in Santiago de Cuba where he is accompanying Jamaican Prime Minster
Michael Manley--said there have been some 60 attempts on his life. He
stressed that one of the plots to which he was subjected was perpetuated
when he visited Chilean President Dr Salvador Allende in 1971. He explained
that at that time an attempt was made to kill both heads of state with arms
hidden in movie cameras. He reported that an attempt to assassinate him was
made in 1961 with a poisoned chocolate milkshake, but the poison had lost
its potency when frozen.

Castro also said the CIA made attempts on the lives of other officials such
as Carlos Rafael Rodriguez, currently vice prime minister for foreign
affairs. Regarding the late President John F. Kennedy and his brothers,
Castro said he had no reasons to assert they were aware of the plans of the
espionage agency.
