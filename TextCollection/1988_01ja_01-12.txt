[Text]  If today I received a pleasant surprise when I found here the
31,000 mini-brigade workers, I request that next year it not be a surprise.
I want to know as of right now that on 28, 29, 30, or 31 December we will
meet again in some other project with the 31,000, 35,000, or 40,000, or
45,000 mini-brigade workers from the construction and social mini-brigades,
and the contingents, as well as outstanding workers, center directors,
those of today and next year's, [applause] and those from whatever schools,
polyclinics, and special schools we build.  I request that we have a event
like today's.  We will look for the place and time.  Had I known that today
we had this, I would have suggested a better time such as late afternoon so
that I could see the crowds, because the back rows can barely be seen.
Maybe we will have it around 1700, 1630, or 1600.  Let's choose a place and
meet again next year [applause] so that we can make an inventory of what we
will have accomplished.

Lastly, Comrades, I wish you and your families not only a good and well
earned rest in these next few days but I also wish you the greatest
successes, congratulations, and the greatest revolutionary congratulations
for 1988.  Fatherland or death, we will win!!  [applause]
-END-
