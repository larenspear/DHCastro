[Text] Commander in Chief Fidel Castro, first secretary of the party's
Central Committee and president of the Councils of State and Ministers, has
visited the medical sciences school in Manzanillo, where he chatted with
professors and students. Fidel expressed interest in the completion of
construction work at the school, and noted that the work is taking too
long.

The Granma Medical Sciences School is still under construction and already
has 1,115 medical students and 128 nursing students enrolled. Once the
installation is finished, capacity will be 1,000 (as heard] students in
both specialties. [video shows Castro speaking with individuals] [Castro]
Has the policy of not beginning a new project before finishing the one
under construction been explained?

[Unidentified speaker] [Words indistinct]

[Castro] There are a number of things here that have been carried out at a
leisurely pace over the years -- hospitals, other things, hotels,
technological school -- but we have to do away with this bottleneck. When
do you intend to finish the maternity hospital?

[Speaker] In the first quarter of this coming year.

[Castro] That's something.
