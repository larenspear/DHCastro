[Excerpts] Commander in Chief Fidel Castro today decorated Brazilian
filmmaker Nelson Pereida dos Santos with the Felix Barela Order, first
class.

Pereida dos Santos expressed his appreciation for the distinction and said
that, more than personal recognition, he interpreted the award as an effort
to stimulate the new Latin American film movement. [passage omitted]

Latin American Film attended a reception offered by Fidel in their honor.
