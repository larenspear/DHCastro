Castro School Dedication Speech

Bucharest SCINTEIA in Romanian 2 Sep 73 p 2 A

[Speech by Fidel Castro at the 31 August dedication of a basic secondary
rural school near Havana]

[Text] Esteemed Comrade Nicolae Ceausescu, esteemed member of the Romanian
party-state delegation, esteemed parents, teachers, pupils and workers:

Today we are engaged in a real Olympic competition to carry out as much as
possible of the program of this visit in a record time. We have just
arrived from Santiago de Cuba and, immediately after the plane landed,
while the engines were still running, we boarded a helicopter to come here.
We shall have to leave here in haste, because the delegation still has part
of its program to finish. Therefore, this ceremony will be very short,
perhaps the shortest ever. There will be no cultural manifestations and the
speeches will be very short.
