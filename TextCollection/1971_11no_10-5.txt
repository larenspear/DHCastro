[Excerpts] Shortly before arriving in Santiago on his official visit, Maj
Fidel Castro sent message of greeting to the presidents of Peru and Chile.

Approaching Peruvian airspace, Castro sent the following message of
greetings to President Juan Velasco Alvarado and to the Peruvian people:

Honorable Mr President:

Flying over your legendary country, our delegation wishes to extend the
Cuban people's fraternal greetings to you and the Peruvian people. We
experience deep emotions as we fly over the land where the great Inca
people long ago built a socialist world and constructed works of
architecture and engineering which still fill the world with wonder.

We also pay sincere tribute to the visionary pioneer Tupac Amaru who almost
2 centuries ago showed today's path to the peoples of America.

Our people follow with great interest and respect the efforts that you and
your comrades-in-arms are making to change the economic and social
structures of Peru, to consolidate its independence, and to insure its
development, and we wish you success in your noble task. As in the bitter
days of Callejon de Juaylas, you and the Peruvian people can always depend
on the Cuban people's sincere and unselfish solidarity.
