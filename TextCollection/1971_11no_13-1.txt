Havana PRENSA LATINA in Spanish 1315 GMT 13 Nov 71 C--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY

[Excerpt] Santiago, Chile, 12 Nov--In all history there has been no
stronger effort against any country than the attempt to bury Cuba under
hatred and malicious deception, Fidel Castro said in an interview with
Augusto Olivaries, director of the state television station.

Castro made the remark in reference to the blockade U.S. imperialism
imposed through the OAS. He noted that the masses of the continent had
prevented the success of the attempt--as evidenced by the massive welcome
the vast popular classes gave him in Chile.

Fidel asked: What would have happened to our revolution without the masses'
faith in our struggle, despite the misrepresentations? Without the masses
we would have been buried under a mass of defamation. He added: "This again
demonstrates the revolutionaries' faith in man, in humanity."
