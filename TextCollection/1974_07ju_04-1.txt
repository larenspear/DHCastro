Urges Continuation of Peron's Policies

Buenos Aires LA NACION in Spanish 4 Jul 74 p 20 X

[Excerpts] Havana--Prime Minister Fidel Castro urged all "responsible"
Argentines to assure the continuity of the policies of deceased President
Juan Domingo Peron.

Castro, together with President Osvaldo Dorticos and a high-ranking
committee of Cuban officials, expressed his sympathy to Argentine
Ambassador to Havana Fernando Insausti. Castro remained in the embassy for
3 hours. Castro said, "What Peron's mere presence assured must now be
assured by all."

After Peron's return to power, Argentine became close to Cuba and it
conducted a policy of frank cooperation with the Caribbean island.
Argentine granted credits and it asked for an end to the ostracism of Cuba
within the inter-American system. Castro emphasized that "nations need
political stability."

Castro said that he was confident that, despite Peron's absence, Argentine
would continue his work which "unfortunately, time did not permit him to
bring to a conclusion."

Argentine under the leadership of Peron, took the lead at the so-called
"dialog of Tlaltelolco" in an effort to reintegrate Cuba in the
inter-American community.

The Argentine Minister of Foreign Relations and Worship is presently
preparing a foreign ministers conference in Buenos Aires for next March
with the intention of inviting Cuba.
