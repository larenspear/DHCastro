[Text] Havana, 1 Aug--Discussing the revolutionary processes of Chile, Peru
and Bolivia, Prime Minister Fidel Castro has stated: "There are not, nor
can there be, two identical paths. Everyone can follow his own path, but
all must get their support from the masses; all must defend themselves from
imperialism." He was answering a question asked by Chilean representatives
from the delegation of the women's front of Popular Unity.

The Cuban prime minister held a lively dialog with the Chilean women's
leaders, who are in this capital at the invitation of the Cuban Government
to participate in activities commemorating the attack of Moncada barracks.

"While emphasizing the existence of different paths, common points must
also be emphasized," the Cuban prime minister asserted.

Castro said that the development of society is governed by general laws,
and that events have proven this throughout history. "We are living in the
era of revolutions," he emphasized.

In his 26 July speech, the Cuban prime minister made several allusions to
the revolutionary processes developing in Chile, Bolivia, and Peru.
