[Text] Commander in Chief Fidel Castro has said in Caracas that Cuba does
not have a sectarian position regarding the OAS and supports integration
and dialogue.  He also characterized the informal Caracas summit being held
on the occasion of the inauguration of Carlos Andres Perez as a symbol of
the growing will of Latin America and the Caribbean to work together to
deal with their problems.  Fidel asserted that the high-level gathering in
Venezuela of heads of state, vice presidents, and other high-ranking
officials shows the appeal of Carlos Andres Perez.  He added that Perez'
inaugural speech was very good.

Since Fidel arrived in Caracas he has removed himself from protocol
measures and his excellent humor has won him the sympathy of those who are
participating in the event.
