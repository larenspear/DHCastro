FIDEL CASTRO DEMANDS AIR INVIOLABILITY

Havana CMQ Television Network in Spanish 0500 GMT 28 October 1962--F

(Text) Fidel Castro, the commander in chief of the armed forces, has
released the following communique: "In statements made today, the U.S.
Government intends to invest itself with the official prerogative of
invading our air space. Cuba does not accept the vandalist and piratical
privilege on the part of any war plane to violate its airspace because such
action would essentially affect its security and would facilitate
conditions for a surprise attack on our territory. This legitimate right of
defense cannot be surrendered and, therefore, any combat plane that invades
Cuban airspace will only do so at the risk of encountering our defensive
fire. Fatherland or death: we will win.

"Signed, Fidel Castro Ruz, commander in chief of the revolutionary armed
forces."
