Talks in High Tatras

Prague Domestic Service in Czech 1230 GMT 24 Jun 72 A

[Text] Today Fidel Castro, first secretary of the Cuban Communist Party
Central Committee and premier of the Revolutionary Government of the Cuban
Republic, is spending the day in the High Tatra Mountains together with his
entourage. On his trip he is accompanied by our prominent representatives,
Comrade Jozef Lenart, Vasil Bilak, Peter Colotka, Jan Janik, Jindrich
Zahradnik, Bohuslav Chnoupek, and others.

Fidel Castro's talks with them and his questions during friendly meetings
testify to the fact that the nature of the Tatra mountains and the partisan
traditions of our people have deeply impressed him. He also recalled the
mountains of Cuba, in which his revolutionary group found a hiding place
and which were the basis of the gradual transformation of this group into
the partisan liberation army.
