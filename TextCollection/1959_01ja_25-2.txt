(Text)  Havana--Many Cubans today attacked delays in punishing the "war
criminals" of the former regime of President Fulgencio Batista and protest
demonstrations have been staged up and down the island.

Last Wednesday Fidel Castro organized a mass meeting at which more than a
million people asked their leader to see that "justice was done."  Since
then demonstrators said the provisional government has been slow in putting
its promises into practice.  They objected in particular to the fact that
former Maj. Jesus Sosa Blanco, condemned to death for the killing of 108
people, is still living, waiting for an appeal against his sentence to be
examined.

On Friday a group of Cuban mothers, led by Senora Dora Rosales de
Westbrook, told a press conference that the population was astonished to
see that "justice" had been suspended in Cuba.  Mrs. Westbrook had a son
killed by Batista's police. "We never had justice under the Batista regime,
but now that we have thrown Batista out we still do not have justice," she
told pressmen.

Meanwhile it was reported that four members of Castro's armed forces were
killed in the street in Havana.  These deaths were attributed to former
Batista policemen.
