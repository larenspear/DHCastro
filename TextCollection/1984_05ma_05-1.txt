FL051946 Havana Domestic Service in Spanish 1800 GMT 5 May 84

[Text] Commander in Chief Fidel Castro, president of the Councils of Sate
and Ministers, has sent a message to participants in the International
Conference on Nicaragua and for Peace in Central America, which is taking
place in the Portuguese capital. In his message to the conference, Fidel
stated: The Latin American and Caribbean peoples have never experienced
such a dangerous time in their entire history. He added that the current
U.S. Administration, allied with the tyrannical and oligarchical regimes of
the region, has assumed the role of gendarme and created an atmosphere of
the threat of military occupation, intervention, aggression, and war.

Later, Fidel pointed out that the Reagan administration is attempting to
smother the struggle of the peoples of Central America with the help of
military means and CIA agents. He remarked that the situation in the region
has become increasingly dangerous because of growing interference by the
United States in the internal affairs of El Salvador. Fidel added that the
White House underestimates the proposals of Nicaragua and for Peace in
Central America that in contrast to the peace initiatives in the area, the
U.S. Administration is becoming more aggressive and is increasing its
threats against Cuba.
