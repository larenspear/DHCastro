[Text] The Nicaraguan Government and the Salvadoran revolutionary movement
advocate a political solution through talks but the Reagan administration
is stubbornly preventing it. This statement was made by Commander in Chief
Fidel Castro in an interview carried on the French television program TS-1.

TASS reported from Paris that Fidel noted that the United States' direct
and indirect intervention can be observed in El Salvador. He added: Direct
intervention is under way because U.S. planes are carrying out espionage
flights over El Salvador to locate guerrilla forces.

In his interview, Fidel said that the Salvadoran Army is formed and armed
by the United States which supports the Salvadoran regime. This regime, he
added, has exterminated more than 40,000 citizens of that country in the
past 4 years.

The Cuban leader said that meanwhile the Salvadoran revolutionary movement
has become stronger. He stressed that it is much more powerful now than it
was 4 years ago and said that he is convinced that this movement will not
be overcome militarily.
