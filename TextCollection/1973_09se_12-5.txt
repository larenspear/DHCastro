[Text] The prime ministers of India and Cuba have spoken of growing
friendship between the two countries. Replying to a toast at a dinner given
in his honor by Mrs Gandhi last night, Dr Castro said the world today is
divided between progressive and reactionary forces. The forward-looking
nations must come together to consolidate peace in the world. He spoke
warmly of India's struggle for freedom and her anticolonial stand. He said
the Indian nation today has a progressive position in all fundamental
issues facing the world. India is also a nonalined country which does not
confuse nonalinement with neutrality in the face of serious problems. Dr
Castro said we are not as big as India but we extend our sincere
friendship, deep sympathy and strong solidarity in India's development
efforts.

Earlier, Mrs Gandhi said Dr Castro's heroic leadership of the Cuban
revolution and his active interest in the cause of the common man has made
him a legend all over the world capturing the imagination of idealistic
people.
