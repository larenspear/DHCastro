[Text]  Commander in Chief Fidel Castro is in Cabo San Antonio, Pinar del
Rio, touring the zones damaged by the winds of hurricane Gilbert which
passed approximately 80 km from Cuba's eastern-most point.

Fidel's visit began at dawn with a session at the provincial general staff
with Fidel Ramos Perera, member of the PCC Central Committee and president
of the Defense Council.  During the meeting he expressed great interest in
the evacuees and asked about the situation of the students.  He also asked
about the precise course of Gilbert--a phenomenon meterologists are
beginning to classify as the storm of the century.

The commander in chief said that we must act quickly now, with extreme
caution, to repair the damage, which basically has affected the areas he is
touring at the moment.  He was also told there are enough supplies to meet
any situation.
