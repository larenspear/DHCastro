Mexico City EL SOL DE MEXICO in Spanish 23 Mar 75 p 1 WA

[Excerpts] Havana, 22 March (OPGV)--Mexico and Cuba are studying the
possibilities of setting up a multinational enterprise for the export of
sugar with other Latin American producers to be invited to participate,
Prime Minister Fidel Castro said last night. [Occasion for remarks not
reported]

An enterprise of this kind might guarantee a better development of the
sugar industry, especially at a time when the world market is very
favorable and in view of Latin America's potential benefits in this sector,
the Cuban prime minister said.

In this respect, the vice minister of the Cuban sugar industry, Guido
Garcia Gonzalez, announced that the current sugar harvest would be very
good but that the Cuban government had decided not to publish figures about
possible production in a strategic move to forestall speculation on the
world market.
