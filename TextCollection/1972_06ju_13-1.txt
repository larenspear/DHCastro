[Excerpts]--On behalf of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of
Cuba and the Revolutionary Government of the Republic of Cuba, Fidel Castro
invited First Secretary of the PUWP Central Committee Edward Gierek and
Premier Piotr Jaroszewicz to pay an official visit of friendship in the
republic of Cuba. The invitation was accepted with pleasure. The date of
this visit will be agreed later.

At the conclusion of his visit, Fidel Castro sent a farewell message to
Edward Gierek and Piotr Jaroszewicz. In it he expressed gratitude for warm
reception and fraternal hospitality.

"We were deeply moved", the message reads, "by proofs of cordiality and
sympathy shown us everywhere, in Warsaw and during our visit in Silesia,
Kracow and Gdansk, for the expressions of the internationalist feelings of
the Polish nation and fraternal friendship linking our two countries.

"We are of the opinion that our visit, contacts and talks will lead to the
furthering and strengthening of our relations on all planes, which
corresponds to the interests of our nations and the nations of the
socialist commonwealth".
