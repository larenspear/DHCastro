[Text] New Delhi, Sep 17 (AFP)--Cuban Prime Minister Fidel Castro left here
today after a 2-hour stopover on his way home from Hanoi during which he
charged the United States with instigating last week's Chilean coup.

Dr. Castro and Indian Prime Minister Mrs. Indira Gandhi went sightseeing in
the walled city of old Delhi, but did not have formal talks.

The Cuban leader alleged in a speech soon after his arrival that the United
States, while blockading loans to the Chilean Government during the Allende
administration, was maintaining close relationships with the Chilean armed
forces and supplying arms. He said he had offered to accept Chilean
refugees in Cuba.

Dr. Castro said he would denounce the Chilean ministry junta's high seas
attacks on defenseless ships and its vain attempt to seize the Cuban
Embassy in Santiago at the United Nations Security Council.

Earlier, during a brief stopover at Calcutta airport, Dr. Castro said he
was confident Chileans would continue to resist the military regime.
