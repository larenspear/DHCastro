FL291920 Havana Domestic Service in Spanish 1700 GMT 29 Mar 84

[Text] Commander in Chief Fidel Castro has sent a message urging workers in
Havana's Plant No 22, where engineering material is built, to intensify
their fight against energy waste. He said that he has asked this from the
nation as a whole and that the workers must decrease to a minimum their
energy use. Fidel added that we must only use that energy which is
essential and not a kilowatt or gram of fuel or oil must be wasted. Fidel
Castro also said that energy conservation must become an integral part of
our people's political awareness.
