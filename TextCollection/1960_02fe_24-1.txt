The commemoration of 24 February -- in this time of the Cuban
Revolution -- involves some new and unusual aspects.  The conventional
speech and the empty phrase are replaced now with the living work and the
immediate achievement.  We honor the glorious past but we do so with a
profound sense of the present and the future.

The two speeches delivered by Prime Minister Dr Fidel Castro on
the occasion of Dia de Baire [Baire Bay] spell out a line of historical
continuity between the Cuban ideal and the revitalizing zeal of New Cuba.
Political independence, the development of culture, and industrial
expansion are inevitably intertwined.  Illiteracy and economic
subordination are also forms of colonization.

In the morning, Fidel Castro addressed thousands of children who
have gathered in the old military fortress of Holguin, which has now been
converted into the "Oscar Lucero" School City, in tribute to one of the
finest heroes of the revolution.  This is another military institution that
has been converted into a school.

In the evening, the Prime Minister attended the meeting which had
been called by the Cuban Confederation of Workers to receive the documents
formalizing the spontaneous decision of the proletariat to contribute 4% of
its income to the great task of industrializing the country.

Both of these speeches -- though they involve different topics --
reveal one and the same trend of thought.  On 24 February we honor the
nation by building schools and factories.
