CASTRO SPEECH

HAVANA FIEL NETWORK IN SPANISH TO CUBA 0212 9/29 E

(FIDEL CASTRO SPEECH AT PRESIDENTIAL PALACE UPON RETURN FROM UNITED
NATIONS)

(SUMMARY)  CUBANS, WE WERE NOT MUCH IN AGREEMENT WITH THE IDEA OF
MOBILIZING THE PEOPLE FOR OUR RETURN.  IT IS NOT LOGICAL THAT EACH TIME WE
GO SOMEWHERE AND RETURN THE PEOPLE SHOULD GIVE US A RECEPTION.  IN ANY
CASE, WE MUST TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE OPPORTUNITY TO SAY A FEW SHORT WORDS OF
TRUTH.

WE BRING BACK A PROFOUND IMPRESSION AND SOME EXPERIENCES FROM THIS
TRIP.  IT IS REALLY A PITY THAT EVERY CUBAN WAS NOT ABLE TO SPEND 10 DAYS
AS WE DID.  WE WOULD GO A BIT FURTHER AND SAY THAT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN
WORTHWHILE FOR THOSE UNFORTUNATE PERSONS WHO HAVE GONE INTO EXILE TO HAVE
SPENT THEIR FIRST 10 DAYS IN NEW YORK AND LIVED AS WE DID.  IT IS DIFFICULT
TO DESCRIBE IT.

WE FEEL THE SAME TOWARD THE REVOLUTION AS YOU DO--THE SAME HOPES, JOYS,
AND EXPERIENCES.  HERE, AMID THE WHIRLWIND OF EVENTS, NEITHER YOU NOR WE
ARE REALLY ABLE TO UNDERSTAND THE TRUE MEANING--NOT INTERNATIONALLY
SPEAKING--OF WHAT THIS NEW COUNTRY WHICH WE ARE BUILDING REPRESENTS FOR
EACH OF US.  I WILL NOT TRY TO EXPLAIN IT BECAUSE I KNOW THAT IT IS
IMPOSSIBLE.  HOWEVER, EXPRESSING THE FEELINGS OF THOSE OF US WHO SPENT 10
DAYS INSIDE THE EMPIRE, WE CONFESS THAT WE REALLY GAINED A CLEAR AND
COMPLETE IDEA OF THE MEANING OF HAVING A COUNTRY, PARTICULARLY NOW THAT WE
ARE NO LONGER A COLONY BUT A TRULY SOVEREIGN AND FREE NATION.

WE BRING BACK AN IMPRESSION AND MEMORY THAT WE SHALL NEVER FORGET--THE
IMPRESSION AND MEMORY OF CUBANS WHO LIVE IN NEW YORK.  ACTUALLY, WE PERHAPS
HAVE NOT THOUGHT SUFFICIENTLY ABOUT THE SITUATION OF THOSE OF OUR PEOPLE
WHO HAD TO LEAVE THE COUNTRY, BECAUSE HERE IN THIS FORMER COLONY OF YANKEE
IMPERIALISM WE DID NOT HAVE MEANS FOR EARNING A LIVING.  IT IS ALWAYS SAID
TO EMIGRATE--TO GO TO A COLD, HOSTILE COUNTRY TO MAKE ONE'S LIVING.  HOW
SAD IT WAS FOR THOSE OF OUR PEOPLE WHO HAD TO TEAR THEMSELVES FROM THE
COUNTRY, AND PARTICULARLY HOW SAD IT IS THAT THEY SHOULD HAVE TON LIVE
ABROAD.  WHAT A DIFFICULT FATE IT IS FOR THOSE CUBANS, THE HEROES OF THE
REVOLUTION.  THE TRUE HEROES OF THE REVOLUTION ARE AT THIS MOMENT THOSE
CUBANS IN THE BRUTAL NORTH, AS MARTI WOULD SAID--THOSE CUBANS WHO REMAIN
LOYAL TO THEIR COUNTRY.  IT IS SADDENING FOR US TO THINK OF THEM, FOR TODAY
THEY ARE LIVING IN NEW YORK AS WE LIVED UNTIL JAN. 1, 1959.

DOZENS OF CUBANS WERE BRUTALLY BEATEN BY HENCHMEN IN NEW YORK WHILE WE
WERE THERE.  IT SUFFICES TO SAY THAT THE STICK--THE NIGHT STICK THAT THE
POLICE USE THERE AND WHICH WAS ABOLISHED IN OUR COUNTRY A LONG TIME AGO--IS
AN INSTITUTION OF TERROR IN THAT SUPERFREE COUNTRY--THAT SUPERDEMOCRATIC,
SUPERHUMANITARIAN, AND SUPERCIVILIZED COUNTRY.  POLICE SEARCHES,
PERSECUTION, AND PROVOCATIONS ARE THE METHODS USED BY THEM AGAINST OUR
COPARIOTS.  EVEN THE MURDERERS OF HUNDREDS OF PEASANTS ARE UNMOLESTED.
THEY BELONG TO THE GREAT FAMILY OF THE FREE WORLD.

HOWEVER, IF IT IS A MATTER OF HONEST CUBANS, CUBANS WHO ARE LOYAL TO
THEIR COUNTRY, CUBANS WHO FEEL FOR THEIR COUNTRY, THE WORST PERSECUTIONS
AWAIT THEM.  IT IS VERY SAD TO THINK THAT THERE ARE CUBANS FORCED BY
POVERTY AND UNEMPLOYMENT TO GO TO ANOTHER COUNTRY AND LIVE AS PAGANS IN
ANCIENT ROME.

DESPITE ALL THIS, THE ENTHUSIASM OF THOSE CUBANS IS TREMENDOUS.  THEIR
LIVE FOR THEIR COUNTRY IS SECOND TO NONE.  ONE MUST SEE THOSE SCENES TO
KNOW WHAT WE MEAN, IN ORDER TO UNDERSTAND WHAT IS LOST WHEN A COUNTRY IS
LOST.  IT IS AS THOUGH THE DREAM OF RETURNING TO LIE IN EITHER COUNTRY ONE
SAY HAS NEVER LEFT THEM, THE DESIRE OF AGAIN FEELING THE WARMTH OF THEIR
LAND.  WE TOOK SOMETHING LIKE AN OATH THAT SOME DAY THOSE CUBANS MUST
RETURN.  SOME DAY THEY MUST RETURN TO WORK HERE IN THEIR COUNTRY, TO LIVE
HERE IN THEIR COUNTRY.

THAT IS WHY WE MUST MAKE EFFORTS, WE MUST STRUGGLE FOR THIS.  IT IS
WORTHWHILE FOR US TO DO EVERYTHING NECESSARY FOR THIS.  IT IS WORTHWHILE
BECAUSE THOSE COMPATRIOTS OF OURS DESERVE IT.  WE MUST ESTABLISH SOMETHING
LIKE A NEW NEIGHBORHOOD WHERE THE CUBANS WHO RETURN FROM ABROAD CAN LIVE.
IN THAT WAY WE CAN COMPENSATE THEM FOR THE HEROISM AND THE FIRMNESS THEY
ARE SHOWING THERE, WHERE ALL IS HOSTILITY, ALL IS PERSECUTION, AND ALL IS
FALSENESS--WHERE THERE ARE ANTI-CUBAN CAMPAIGNS AND LIES.  YET THEY, LIKE
THE NEGROES OF HARLEM, REMAIN FIRM.  (APPLAUSE AND CHANTING)

WE MUST MAKE AN EFFORT EVEN TO IMAGINE THE CAMPAIGN THAT IS BEING WAGED
SYSTEMATICALLY AGAINST CUBA BY ALL THE MAGAZINES, NEWSPAPERS, RADIOS AND
TELEVISION STATIONS.  YET THE CUBANS, THE DOMINICANS, THE PUERTO RICANS,
THE NEGROES OF HARLEM, AND THE LATIN AMERICANS IN GENERAL, REMAIN FIRM.
THEY ARE THE GROUPS MOST EXPLOITED AND OPPRESSED BY IMPERIALISM IN ITS OWN
TERRITORY.  IT IS VERY MOVING.  FROM THE TIME OUR DELEGATION BEGAN
TRAVELING THROUGH HARLEM, FROM THE INSTANT A NEGRO SAW US, HE BEGAN TO WAVE
TO US IN GREETING.

IN THE VERY HEART OF THE EMPIRE THERE ARE 20 MILLION NEGROES,
OPPRESSED AND EXPLOITED.  THEIR ASPIRATIONS CANNOT BE SATISFIED WITH A
FISTFUL OF DOLLARS, IT IS A VERY MUCH MORE DIFFICULT PROBLEM, BECAUSE THEIR
ASPIRATIONS CAN ONLY BE SATISFIED BY JUSTICE.  AND WE, RECIPROCATING FOR
THE HOSPITALITY WE RECEIVED, HAVE INVITED 300 REPRESENTATIVES OF U.S.
NEGROES TO VISIT OUR COUNTRY SO THAT THEY CAN LEARN FIRSTHAND THE WORK OF
THE REVOLUTION, SO THEY CAN SEE FROM FIRSTHAND A COUNTRY WHERE THERE IS
JUSTICE.

BUT THERE ARE ALSO MANY THINKING PEOPLE IN THE UNITED
STATES--PARTICULARLY WRITERS--HONEST PEOPLE, WHO HAVE HAD THE COURAGE TO
EXPRESS PUBLICLY RIGHT THERE THEIR SYMPATHY FOR THE CUBAN REVOLUTION
THROUGH A "FAIR PLAY FOR CUBAN COMMITTEE" THEY FORMED.  IT INCLUDES SOME OF
THE MOST INTELLIGENT AND INFLUENTIAL PEOPLE IN THE UNITED STATES.

THERE ARE ALSO OTHERS IN THE UNITED STATES WHO ARE OPPRESSED.  THERE
ARE MANY FARMERS WHO ARE DEFRAUDED BY THE GREAT MONOPOLIES OF THE UNITED
STATES.  ONE MUST LIVE 10 DAYS IN THE BOWELS OF THE IMPERIALIST MONSTER TO
KNOW THAT MONOPOLY AND PUBLICITY THERE ARE ONE AND THE SAME THING.  SINCE
WE HAVE BEEN ENEMIES OF THE MONOPOLIES, SINCE WE HAVE FOUGHT AGAINST THE
MOST POWERFUL OF THE MONOPOLIES OF THE EMPIRE, THE ORGANS OF PUBLICITY
FOUGHT US.  BUT THEY DID NOT FIGHT WITH REASON, FOR THEY REALLY LACKED
THIS.  THEY COMBATED US WITH LIES, WITH ALL TYPES OF FALSEHOODS, INVENTIONS
THAT REMIND US OF OUR INGENIOUS DAYS WHEN WE THOUGHT THE STORIES SENT US BY
THE NEWS AGENCIES OF THE MONOPOLIES WERE TRUE.  (CHANTING, APPLAUSE)

IN OUR INGENIOUSNESS WERE WERE MADE TO BELIEVE THAT THEFT WAS NOBLE,
THAT EXPLOITATION WAS JUST, THAT LIES WERE TRUTH, AND THAT THE TRUTH WAS A
LIE.

(CONTINUING SUMMARY) ALL THAT FALSE PROPAGANDA CONSTANTLY FALLS ON THE
PEOPLE OF THE UNITED STATES, AS IT DID ON US BEFORE.  THEY TRY TO FOOL THE
PEOPLE OF THE UNITED STATES CONSTANTLY.  INDEPENDENT PAPERS, PAPERS THAT
TELL THE TRUTH, CANNOT EXIST THERE.  PAPERS THAT TELL THE TRUTH ARE LEFT
WITHOUT ADVERTISEMENTS; ADVERTISING AGENCIES ARE ABSOLUTELY CONTROLLED BY
MONOPOLIES.  THERE NEVER IS HEALTHY CRITICISM THERE; EVERYTHING IS
MOTIVATED BY GAIN, BY MATERIAL INTERESTS, BY MONEY, BY WHAT WILL BE PAID
FOR PROPAGANDA.  ALL THIS EXPLAINS THE RESULTS.  ONE RESULT IS THE HYSTERIA
WHICH HAS BEEN CREATED AMONG A PART OF THE PEOPLE.  ONE CANNOT UNDERSTAND
HOW IT IS POSSIBLE TO LIVE AMID THE FROTHING RAGE OF SOME PEOPLE THERE.

HOW DIFFERENT THE RESULT WHEN PEOPLE ARE WELL ORIENTED, WHEN THEY KNOW
THE TRUTH, WHEN THEY FIGHT FOR SOMETHING, WHEN THE LIFE OF A NATION HAS A
MEANING, AN IDEAL, AN OBJECTIVE TO FIGHT FOR.

DESPITE ALL THE INSULTS WE SUFFERED, DESPITE ALL THE AGGRESSIONS OUR
COUNTRY HAS SUSTAINED, WE HAVE THE UTMOST CONFIDENCE THAT IF THE U.N.
HEADQUARTERS WERE ESTABLISHED HERE, NO CUBAN WOULD INSULT A SINGLE VISITOR,
THAT THERE WOULD BE NO ACT OF HOSTILITY AGAINST ANY DELEGATION.  THE CUBANS
WOULD KNOW THAT THE OPPORTUNITY HAD COME TO SHOW THAT WE ARE A THOUSAND
TIMES MORE DECENT THAN THE IMPERIALISTS (APPLAUSE), THAT WE ARE A THOUSAND
TIMES MORE GENTLEMANLY THAN THE IMPERIALISTS (APPLAUSE), THAT WE ARE A
THOUSAND TIMES MORE HOSPITABLE THAN THE IMPERIALISTS, AND THAT WE ARE A
MILLION TIMES MORE HONORABLE THAN THE IMPERIALISTS.  (APPLAUSE)  WHEN ONE
IS HONORABLE, HE DISPLAYS HONOR.  WHEN ONE IS DECENT, HE SHOWS DECENCY.
BUT WHEN ONE IS ONLY SHAMELESS, ONLY SHAMLESSNESS IS SHOWN.

WE OBSERVED HONOR AND HOSPITALITY AND GENEROUS CONDUCT AND DECENCY
AMONG THE HUMBLE NEGROES OF HARLEM.  (APPLAUSE, CHANTING, AND SINGING--AT
THIS POINT A SMALL EXPLOSIVE APPARENTLY WENT OFF IN THE CROWD--ED.)

THAT LITTLE PETARD!  EVERYBODY KNOWS WHO PAID FOR IT!  IT IS ONE OF
IMPERIALISM'S.  TOMORROW YOU WILL READ--NOTE THIS WELL--THAT THE PETARD
WENT OFF JUST AS THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT IMPERIALISM.  (CROWD NOISE AGAIN
FOR SEVERAL MINUTES.  MUSIC PLAYED TO QUIET THE CROWD--ED.)

HOW NAIVE THEY ARE.  WHEN THEY FIRED 500 AND 1000-POUND BOMBS MARKED
"MADE U.S.A." THEY COULDN'T DO A THING--NOT EVEN WHEN THEY FIRED NAPALM
BOMBS--AND THEIR PLANES COULDN'T DO ANYTHING.  THEY HAD TO SURRENDER.  THEY
COULDN'T TAKE THE SIERRA MAESTRA.  HOW ARE THEY GOING TO ADVANCE NOW BEHIND
THE LITTLE EXPLOSIVES.  (CROWD CALLS OUR "PAREDON, PAREDON, PAREDON; TO THE
WALL--ED.)

HOW ARE THEY GOING TO IMPRESS THE PEOPLE WITH LITTLE BOMBS, IF THE
PEOPLE HERE ARE PREPARING TO RESIST NOT JUST LITTLE BOMBS? THE PEOPLE
ARE PREPARED TO RESIST ANYTHING THAT FALLS, EVEN ATOMIC BOMBS. FOR EVERY
LITTLE BOMB OF THE IMPERIALISTS WE BUILD 500 HOUSES. FOR EVERY LITTLE
BOMB THEY MAKE IN A YEAR, WE CONSTRUCT THREE COOPERATIVE HOUSES. FOR
EVERY LITTLE BOMB WE NATIONALIZE A YANKEE ESTATE. FOR EVERY LITTLE BOMB
OF THE IMPERIALISTS WE REFINE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF BARRELS OF OIL.
FOR EVERY LITTLE BOMB WE WILL BUILD A PLANT TO GIVE EMPLOYMENT IN OUR
COUNTRY. FOR EVERY LITTLE BOMB THE IMPERIALISTS PAY FOR, WE MAKE A
REVOLUTIONARY LAW. FOR EVERY LITTLE BOMB THE IMPERIALISTS PAY FOR, WE
ARM AT LEAST 1,000 MILITIAMEN. (APPLAUSE)

COMRADE (PANI) HAD A GOOD IDEA.  HE SAYS WE SHOULD DEDICATE A NEW LABOR
CIRCLE, A REGIMENT, TO THIS LITTLE BOMB.  (CHANTING)

WE ARE GOING TO ESTABLISH A SYSTEM OF COLLECTIVE REVOLUTIONARY
VIGILANCE, AND WE SHALL SEE HOW THE LACKEYS OF IMPERIALISM WILL GET AROUND
THIS.  WE SHALL SEE IF THERE IS A SINGLE DISTRICT NOT WELL REPRESENTED
HERE.  WE SHALL SET UP A COLLECTIVE REVOLUTIONARY VIGILANCE SYSTEM, AND
EVERYONE ON THE BLOCK WILL BE KNOWN.  THE GROUP WILL FIND OUT WHAT EVERYONE
ON THE BLOCK IS DOING, HIS RELATIONS WITH TYRANNY, WHAT HE DOES, WHOM HE
KNOWS, WHAT HIS ACTIVITIES ARE.  IF THEY THINK THEY ARE GOING TO HAVE TO
DEAL WITH THE PEOPLE THEY WILL GET A TREMENDOUS SCARE.  WE ARE GOING TO SET
UP A REVOLUTIONARY VIGILANCE COMMITTEE ON EVERY BLOCK SO THAT THE PEOPLE
CAN SEE WHAT IS GOING ON.

THE IMPERIALISTS AND THEIR LACKEYS WILL NOT BE ABLE TO MAKE A MOVE.
THEY ARE DEALING WITH THE PEOPLE, AND THEY DO NOT KNOW YET THE TREMENDOUS
REVOLUTIONARY POWER OF THE PEOPLE.  THEREFORE NEW STEPS MUST BE TAKEN IN
ORGANIZATION OF THE MILITIA.  MILITIA BATTALIONS WILL BE CREATED THROUGHOUT
CUBA.  EACH MAN FOR EACH WEAPON WILL BE SELECTED.  A STRUCTURE WILL BE
GIVEN TO THE ENTIRE MASS OF MILITIAMEN, SO THAT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE OUR
COMBAT UNIT WILL BE PERFECTLY FORMED AND TRAINED.  ONE THING IS CLEAR:  WE
DO NOT HAVE TO TIGHTEN UP BEFORE THE TIME COMES.  THERE IS NOTHING TO
WORRY ABOUT.  ONE MUST NOT WORRY.  LET THEM DO THE WORRYING.  WE WILL
CONSERVE OUR SERENITY AND OUR MARCH; IT IS A FIRM BUT SURE MARCH.

ONE OF OUR IMPRESSIONS ON THIS TRIP, THIS IMPORTANT TRIP, IS THE AMOUNT
OF HATRED FELT TOWARD OUR REVOLUTIONARY PEOPLE BY IMPERIALISM--THE DEGREE
OF HYSTERIA WHICH IMPERIALISM HAS REACHED, THE DEGREE OF DEMORALIZATION
WHICH IMPERIALISM HAS REACHED.  YOU HAVE SEEN IT.  THEY ARE STILL THINKING
ABOUT THE CUBAN CHARGES BECAUSE THEY REALLY DO NOT HAVE ANYTHING WITH WHICH
TO REPLY.

IT IS, HOWEVER, IMPORTANT THAT ALL OF US BE VERY CONSCIOUS OF THE
STRUGGLE UNDERTAKEN BY OUR REVOLUTION.  IT IS NECESSARY FOR ALL OF US TO
KNOW PERFECTLY WELL THAT IT WILL BE A LONG--LONG AND HARD--STRUGGLE.
(APPLAUSE)  IT IS IMPORTANT FOR US TO REALIZE THAT OUR REVOLUTION HAS FACED
UP TO THE MOST POWERFUL EMPIRE IN THE WORLD.  OF ALL THE COLONIALIST AND
IMPERIALIST COUNTRIES, YANKEE IMPERIALISM IS THE MOST POWERFUL IN
DIPLOMATIC INFLUENCE AND MILITARY RESOURCES.  IT IS ALSO AN IMPERIALISM
THAT IS NOT LIKE THE ENGLISH, WHICH IS MORE MATURE, MORE EXPERIENCED.  IT
IS A PROUD IMPERIALISM, BARBAROUS, AND MANY OF ITS LEADERS ARE BARBAROUS
MEN WHO ARE SIMILAR TO THE FIRST (CAVEMEN).  MANY OF THEIR LEADERS ARE MEN
WITH FANGS.  IT IS THE MOST AGGRESSIVE, MOST WARLIKE, AND MOST STUPID
IMPERIALISM.

WE ARE ON THE FRONTLINE--A SMALL COUNTRY WITH FEW ECONOMIC RESOURCES
GIVING BATTLE ON THE FRONTLINE FOR OUR SOVEREIGNTY, DESTINY, AND RIGHT.  IT
IS NECESSARY TO BE QUITE CONSCIOUS OF THE FACT THAT OUR COUNTRY IS FACING
THE MOST FIERCE EMPIRE OF CONTEMPORARY TIMES.  IT MUST ALSO BE REALIZED
THAT IMPERIALISM WILL NOT STOP TRYING TO DESTROY OR HINDER THE REVOLUTION.
IT MUST ALWAYS BE BORNE IN MIND THAT IMPERIALISM HATES US WITH THE HATRED
OF THE MASTER FOR THE REBELLIOUS SLAVE, AND WE WILL DEFEND OURSELVES WITH
THE FIERCENESS OF SLAVES WHO HAVE REBELLED.

(CONTINUING SUMMARY)  THERE IS NOTHING MORE FIERCE THAN THE HATRED OF
THE MASTER FOR THE REBELLIOUS SLAVE.  AND TO THAT MUST BE ADDED THE FACT
THAT THE IMPERIALISTS SEE THEIR INTERESTS ENDANGERED--NOT ONLY HERE BUT
THROUGHOUT THE WORLD.  WE BROUGHT OUR CASE TO THE UNITED NATIONS, BUT OUR
CASE WAS THE CASE OF ALL UNDERDEVELOPED COUNTRIES--THE CASE OF LATIN
AMERICA, AFRICA, THE MIDDLE EAST, THE CASE OF THE ASIAN COUNTRIES.  OUR
CASE WAS ONE THAT COULD BE APPLIED TO THE REST OF THE WORLD.  THE REST OF
THE UNDERDEVELOPED WORLD IS ALSO BEING EXPLOITED BY THE MONOPOLIES.  WE
TOLD THEM THAT THE PROPERTY OF THE MONOPOLIES MUST BE NATIONALIZED WITHOUT
ANY INDEMNIFICATION.  WE TOLD THE OTHER COUNTRIES:  DO WHAT WE HAVE DONE;
DO NOT CONTINUE TO BE VICTIMS OF AGGRESSION.

THEREFORE THERE IS A UNIVERSAL INTEREST IN OUR STRUGGLE. A BATTLE IS
TAKING PLACE FOR LIBERATION OF CUBA AND ALL OTHER EXPLOITED NATIONS OF
THE WORLD. IT IS NECESSARY FOR US TO KNOW WHAT WE ARE DOING, THE
INTERESTS WE ARE AFFECTING. THOSE INTERESTS WILL NOT RAISE THE WHITE
FLAG EASILY. IT WILL BE A LONG FIGHT. NOT ONLY DO WE HAVE TO DEFEND
OURSELVES FROM AGGRESSION, BUT WE MUST ALSO ADVANCE. WE MUST PROGRESS ON
ALL FRONTS. THE MOST CLEAR IMPRESSION WE BROUGHT BACK IS THAT WE MUST
REDOUBLE OUR EFFORTS (APPLAUSE), THAT WE MUST BE AWARE OF THE GREAT ROLE
WE ARE PLAYING IN THE WORLD. ACTIONS ARE WORTH MORE THAN WORDS. WE HAVE
SPOKEN OF SOME OF THE THINGS WE HAVE DONE. THE IMPORTANT THING IS
ACTION, DEEDS. WE MUST MAKE OUR COUNTRY ADVANCE. TO DO THIS WE MUST
DEVOTE OURSELVES TO OUR TASK. WE ALL HAVE A TASK.

WE WENT THERE TO SPEAK ON BEHALF OF ALL OF YOU.  WE WENT BECAUSE WE
HAVE THE SUPPORT OF ALL OF YOU.  WE COULD DO THIS BECAUSE WE TOOK WITH US
THE MORAL SUPPORT OF ALL THE MEN AND WOMEN OF OUR COUNTRY.  WE TOOK WITH US
THE MORAL STRENGTH OF A PEOPLE.  THAT IS WHY WE COULD GO THERE TO DENOUNCE
IMPERIALISM, AND THAT IS WHY OUR COUNTRY IS ADMIRED--NOT FOR THE WORDS, BUT
FOR THE DEEDS; NOT FOR WHAT A CUBAN MAY SAY THERE, BUT FOR WHAT ALL THE
CUBANS MAY DO AND CAN DO.

THE WORLD IS FORMING AN IDEA OF US, A BETTER IDEA THAN IT EVER HAD--IF
THE WORLD EVER HAD AN IDEA OF OUR EXISTENCE.  WHAT IS BEHIND THAT OPINION
IS A PEOPLE.  WHAT MAKES THAT OPINION IS THE EFFORTS OF A PEOPLE.  WE URGE
EACH AND EVERY ONE OF YOU TO FORM AN IMAGE OF THE GREAT RESPONSIBILITY
EACH OF US HAS.  WE ARE NOT INDIVIDUALS.  WE ARE PART OF A PEOPLE.  WE ARE
PART OF HUMANITY, AT A DECISIVE HOUR FOR THE HUMAN RACE.  WE ARE AN IDEA;
WE ARE A HOPE.  WE ARE AN EXAMPLE.  AND WHEN THE PREMIER OF THE
REVOLUTIONARY GOVERNMENT APPEARED AT THE UNITED NATIONS (APPLAUSE) IT WAS
NOT A MAN APPEARING, IT WAS A NATION.  (APPLAUSE)

EVERY ONE OF YOU APPEARED THERE; EVERY ONE OF YOU WAS THERE.  WE WENT
THERE WITH THE FORCE WE RECEIVE FROM BEING ABLE TO COUNT ON THE SUPPORT AND
EFFORT OF EVERY ONE OF YOU.  WE FELT OBLIGATED TO THE PEOPLE; WE FEEL WE
HAVE A GREAT RESPONSIBILITY TO THE PEOPLE AND SO EVERY ONE OF YOU MUST
FEEL--AND KEEP THIS IN MIND--THE WORK WE ARE GOING.  WE ARE ALL DOING IT
TOGETHER.

(EDITOR'S NOTE:  ANOTHER SMALL EXPLOSIVE APPARENTLY GOES OFF.  THERE
ARE SHOUTS FROM THE CROWD.  THE NATIONAL ANTHEM IS PLAYED AND SUNG)

LET THEM EXPLODE.  THAT WAY THEY ARE TRAINING THE PEOPLE TO BECOME
ACCUSTOMED TO ALL KINDS OF NOISE.  (CHANTS OF "UNITY" HEARD) APPARENTLY
TONIGHT HIS LORDSHIP WILL HAVE A BIG BILL TO PAY.  (CROWD NOISE IS HEARD
AGAIN)  THESE THINGS JUST CONFIRM WHAT WE HAVE BEEN SAYING:   THAT THE
REVOLUTION HAS A LONG BATTLE AHEAD, A HARD BATTLE.  THEREFORE WE REITERATE
THAT EVERY ONE OF US SHOULD TAKE TO HEART HIS ROLE AND HIS RESPONSIBILITY.
EASY THINGS ARE NOT THOSE THAT GIVE THE BEST FRUITS IN THE LONG RUN.  THE
WORTHWHILE THINGS IN THE LIVES OF NATIONS AND PEOPLE ARE THE DIFFICULT
THINGS, FOR THESE ARE THE ONES WORTH DOING.  (APPLAUSE)

KNOWING THE MIGHT OF THE EMPIRE WE FACE DOES NOT DISCOURAGE US. ON
THE CONTRARY, IT ENCOURAGES US. THE ONE THAT SHOULD BE DEMORALIZED IS
THE EMPIRE, BECAUSE OF THE BATTLE BEING WAGED AGAINST IT BY A SMALL
NATION. LET NOBODY THINK THAT THE YEARS AHEAD WILL BE YEARS OF
TRANQUILITY AND EASE. THE GREATEST INTEREST IN TH YEARS AHEAD IS THE
WORK, AND THE BATTLE WE HAVE AHEAD OF US. THIS IS THE EXTRAORDINARY
INTEREST WHICH THE FUTURE HOLDS FOR US. THAT IS WHAT LIBERATES US FROM
THE SORROWS AND SHAME OF THE PAST. THAT IS WHAT MAKES OUR PEOPLE
HAPPY--ABOVE ALL, KNOWING THAT ON JAN. 1 THE REVOLUTION DID NOT END, BUT
WAS JUST BEGINNING. THAT IS WHAT MAKES OUR PEOPLE HAPPY, THINKING THAT
IF THE FIRST STAGE WAS THE FRUIT OF EFFORT BY PART OF THE NATION, THE
FUTURE, TOMORROW'S VICTORY, WILL BE THE FRUIT OF THE EFFORT OF THE
ENTIRE NATION.

TOMORROW NO ONE NEED FEEL SHAME, BECAUSE THE FUTURE IS FULL OF NICHES,
THERE IS A PLACE FOR EACH OF US.  THERE IS A PLACE FOR EVERY ONE OF US, WE
WE OURSELVES FEEL THAT WE ARE BEGINNING, THAT WE HAVE BARELY BEGUN, THAT WE
ARE ON THE FIRST PAGES OF THE GREAT BOOK OF HISTORY WHICH THE CUBAN PEOPLE
ARE WRITING.  (APPLAUSE)  THIS VICTORY WILL WIN WITH TWO THINGS:
INTELLIGENCE AND COURAGE.  (APPLAUSE)  NEITHER INTELLIGENCE NOR COURAGE
MUST GET AHEAD; BOTH MUST MARCH TOGETHER ON THE ROAD TO VICTORY.
(APPLAUSE)  UP TO TODAY, THOSE HAVE BEEN THE MAIN ESSENTIALS OF THE
SUCCESSES WE HAVE ACHIEVED.

IT WOULD BE A MISTAKE TO UNDERESTIMATE THE IMPERIALISTIC ENEMY.  HE
MADE THE MISTAKE OF UNDERESTIMATING US.  (APPLAUSE)  IN OUR PEOPLE THERE
HAS BEEN A GREATER REVOLUTIONARY FORCE THAN THEY EVER IMAGINED.  IN OUR
PEOPLE THERE HAS BEEN A GREATER MORAL FORCE THAN THEY EVER IMAGINED.  WE
MUST NOT COMMIT THE MISTAKE OF UNDERESTIMATING THE IMPERIALIST ENEMY.  WE
WILL CORRECTLY ESTIMATE HIS POWER AND DO WHAT IS NECESSARY TO BE VICTORIOUS
IN THIS BATTLE FOR LIBERATION OF OUR COUNTRY.  WE WANT TO KNOW EVERY MOMENT
WHAT THEY ARE PLANNING, WHAT THEY ARE DOING AND HOW TO COMBAT IT, AS WE ARE
DOING RIGHT NOW IN DENOUNCING THE HYSTERIA THEY ARE CREATING ABOUT THE
BASE, AND THE REPORTS ABOUT OUR ATTACKING THE BASE.  WE ASKED THE
PRESIDENT OF THE ASSEMBLY TO TAKE NOTE OF OUR CONCERN OVER THE CAMPAIGNS
THEY HAVE BEEN UNDERTAKING IN ORDER TO CREATE A PRETEXT FOR AGGRESSION
AGAINST OUR COUNTRY.

WE DON'T WANT THEM TO INVADE OUR COUNTRY.  WE DON'T WANT TO GIVE THEM A
PRETEXT FOR INVADING IT.  WHAT THEY WOULD LIKE IS THAT WE ALLOW OURSELVES
TO DO AS THEY WISH.  WE SHOULD DO WHAT WE WANT TO DO AND WHAT IS BENEFICIAL
FOR US, NOT FOR THEM.  MARTI SAID:  NEVER DO WHAT THE ENEMY WANTS YOU TO
DO.  THAT IS WHY WE HAVE ALWAYS EXPLAINED, AS WE DID AT THE UNITED NATIONS,
THAT WE WOULD DEMAND OUR SOVEREIGNTY BY LEGAL MEANS, THROUGH INTERNATIONAL
LAW, NOT THROUGH ARMS.  OUR ARMS ARE NOT TO SERVE THE ENEMY, BUT TO COMBAT
IT.  OUR WEAPONS SHOULD ALWAYS BE READY FOR WHAT THE ENEMY DOES NOT
WANT--FOR OUR DEFENSE, FOR RESISTANCE.

"IT IS NECESSARY THAT THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE LISTENED TO OUR WORDS IN THE
UNITED NATIONS KNOW THAT ONE OF THE MOST DELICATE PROBLEMS, ONE IN WHICH WE
MUST ACT WITH THE MOST INTELLIGENCE, ONE IN WHICH WE MUST OVERCOME THE
IMPERIALIST ENEMY, IS THAT OF THE CAIMANERA BASE, BECAUSE THAT BASE IS THE
ONE THEY WILL TRY TO USE AS A PRETEXT.  OUR POSITION MUST BE CLEAR TO THE
PEOPLE AND TO THE ENTIRE WORLD:  THAT WHEN WE GO TO RECLAIM IT WE WILL
RECLAIM IT IN ACCORDANCE WITH INTERNATIONAL LAW, AS ONE OF OUR UNDENIABLE
RIGHTS WHICH THEY WILL HAVE TO ACKNOWLEDGE."

AGAINST THE IMPERIALIST ENEMY THE BEST THING TO DO IS TO BAR ITS PATH
WHEN IT SEEKS A PRETEXT AND TELL IT:  SEEK ANOTHER WAY, FOR THAT ONE WILL
NOT BE OPEN TO YOU.

(CONCLUDING SUMMARY)  THE IMPERIALIST ENEMY IS CAPABLE OF THE
UNIMAGINABLE.  THE ENEMY USES ANY WEAPONS--FROM THE MURDER OF LEADERS TO
MILITARY INVASIONS--ALWAYS SEEKING THE MURDERING HAND, THE GANGSTER, THE
PRETEXT.  AND WE SHOULD NOT ONLY BE VALIANT, BUT ALSO INTELLIGENT.  WE MUST
WIN THE BATTLE.  WE MUST BE VICTORIOUS AGAINST THE IMPERIALIST ENEMY.  WE
MUST WIN ALL BATTLES, AS WE HAVE WON IN THE UNITED NATIONS.

THE IMPERIALIST ENEMY IS BEING DEFEATED IN THE UNITED NATIONS.
SUPPORTERS OF ARMAMENTS, ENEMIES OF PEACE, MILITARISTS, ARE RECEIVING ROUGH
BLOWS IN THE UNITED NATIONS.  THE IMPERIALIST ENEMY MUST BE DEMORALIZED
BEFORE A WAR.  ENEMIES OF PEACE, THOSE WHO PLAY WITH THE FATE OF ALL
HUMANITY, MUST BE DEFEATED ON ALL FRONTS.

WE MUST GO ON ORIENTING OURSELVES, PREPARING OURSELVES MENTALLY, AND
EDUCATING OURSELVES ON THESE QUESTIONS.  OUR INTEREST IN INTERNATIONAL
PROBLEMS MUST NOT LAG.  PREVIOUSLY WE DID NOT CARE ABOUT INTERNATIONAL
PROBLEMS, BECAUSE WE WERE ONLY INTERESTED IN WHAT THE YANKEE DELEGATE USED
TO SAY.  WE WERE ALWAYS SILENT AND OBEDIENT.  THAT IS WHY NO ONE WORRIED.
THEY WOULD SAY:  THIS IS A YANKEE PROBLEM.  BUT NOW THAT WE ALSO HAVE
OPINIONS IN THE WORLD, NOW THAT WE ARE ALSO IN THE WORLD, IT IS GOOD FOR US
TO KNOW WHAT IS HAPPENING IN LATIN AMERICA, ASIA, AFRICA--WHAT PEOPLES LIVE
THERE, WHAT ARE THEIR PROBLEMS, WHAT ARE THE POSITIONS OF THEIR
GOVERNMENTS.

THAT IS WHY IT IS GOOD FOR MANY BOOKS TO BE PUBLISHED AND FOR US TO
CONTINUE TO STUDY.  ALL OF US HAVE A DUTY TO LEARN, TO KNOW, AND TO TEACH.
THE OPPORTUNITY MUST BE TAKEN TO LEARN OF THE PROBLEMS, TO KNOW OF THE
ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL PROBLEMS, OF CUBA AND NATIONS OUTSIDE OF CUBA.
OTHERWISE WE WILL NEVER BE MORE THAN BACHELORS OF REVOLUTION; WE WILL NEVER
BECOME DOCTORS OF REVOLUTION.  BOOKS SHOULD BE READ AT SOCIAL CIRCLES, IN
MILITARY CAMPS, IN UNIONS--EVERYWHERE.  WE MUST LEARN WHAT WE MUST KNOW.
ALL CAN BE SURE THAT WHAT THE CUBAN CANNOT LEARN CANNOT BE LEARNED BY
ANYONE.

FROM OUR IMPRESSIONS ON OUR TRIP, THESE ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT
CONCLUSIONS:  THE ROLE OF CUBA, THE IDEA OF THE STRUGGLE AHEAD, THE NEED
FOR INTELLIGENCE AND VALOR, THE NEED TO WORK HARDER.  WE MUST BE ABLE TO
TELL WHAT WE HAVE DONE.  WE ARE BUILDING A GREAT LAND AND WE ARE PROUD OF
IT.  WE ALONE ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR WHAT WE HAVE DONE AND WHAT ARE ARE DOING.
WE WILL NOT DO IT FOR THE SAKE OF VANITY.  WE WILL DO IT BECAUSE IT IS GOOD
FOR OUR PEOPLE.  WE WILL TRY TO DO THE MOST PERFECT WORK POSSIBLE, SO THAT
IT WILL BE OUR BEST DEFENSE, SO THAT WE CAN SAY:  COME TO SEE OUR
COOPERATIVES, HOUSES, SCHOOLS, AND UNIVERSITIES.  (APPLAUSE)

LET THEM COME.  WE WILL ALWAYS HAVE SOMETHING TO SHOW.  WE WILL SHOW
THE MILITIA, THE YOUTH BRIGADES, THE GREAT REFORESTATION PROJECTS, THE
SCHOOL CITIES WE ARE BUILDING.  WE WILL SHOW WHAT OUR COUNTRY IS.  THOSE
WHO HAVE COME TO SEE WHAT WE ARE DOING ARE ASTONISHED THAT A SMALL NATION,
FACING SO MANY OBSTACLES, CAN DO SO MUCH.  THIS WILL ALWAYS BE A REASON FOR
PRIDE WITH US.  IT IS WHAT SUSTAINS THE SPIRITS OF OUR COMPATRIOTS IN NEW
YORK.  IT IS THE PRIDE THAT SUSTAINS OUR DELEGATES ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD.
IT IS THE BASIC IDEA WE WANTED TO EXPOSE HERE TONIGHT.

AND THANKS FOR THE TWW LITTLE PETARDS, FOR THEY HAVE BEEN VALUABLE
REGARDING WHAT WE HAVE BEEN EXPLAINING.  THEY DEMONSTRATED THE METTLE OF
OUR PEOPLE, THE COURAGE OF OUR PEOPLE. (APPLAUSE NOT A SINGLE WOMAN BUDGED
FROM HER PLACE.  (APPLAUSE)  NOT A SINGLE MAN BUDGED. (APPLAUSE)  NOR WILL
ANYONE BUDGE FROM HIS POST IN THE FACE OF ANY DANGER, ANY ATTACK.  WE ARE
SOLDIERS OF THE COUNTRY.  WE DO NOT BELONG TO OURSELVES:  WE BELONG TO OUR
COUNTRY.  (APPLAUSE)  IT DOES NOT MATTER IF ANY ONE OF US FALLS; WHAT
MATTERS IS THAT THIS FLAG SHALL REMAIN HIGH.  THE IDEA SHALL GO FORWARD;
OUR COUNTRY SHALL LIVE.  (APPLAUSE)
-END-
