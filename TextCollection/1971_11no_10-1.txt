Lima Stopover

Havana PRESNA LATINA in Spanish 1330 GMT 10 Nov 71 C--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY

[Excerpt] Havana, 10 Nov--Asked about rumors of a stopover in Lima enroute
to Santiago, Chile, and President Juan Velasco Alvarado's statement about a
possible landing in Lima, Castro said: "The trip has been planned for
several weeks. Then we learned of the kind, friendly statement by the
Peruvian Government that they would be willing to meet us at the airport,
but everything had already been planned and all the problems and the
itinerary of the trip had been settled."

The Cuban leader added: "It seems simple, but in planning a long strip like
this departure and arrival times must be fixed and it is not easy to
introduce modifications. If it were easy, we would have made some changes."
