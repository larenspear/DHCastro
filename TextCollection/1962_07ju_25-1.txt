(Excerpts) The citizens and visitors of Santiago de Cuba joyfully received
Prime Minister Fidel Castro the afternoon on 23 July. Castro walked through
several streets of the city in the company of Maj. Rene Vallejo and other
officers of the rebel army. The people applauded the maximum leader who
attended the meeting at Oriente theater in which the first Frank Pais
teachers brigade was established. Castro said at the meeting that the most
important factor in a revolution is education. He added that "the
revolution cannot progress without education."

Fidel Castro went on to say that the volunteer teachers ought to have a
firmer awareness of their profession in accordance with the environment and
the period during which they were active. He added that it was not his
opinion that outstanding teachers should terminate the course next year,
but that they should study another year to be prepared properly to teach
the fifth and sixth grade in the mountain areas. If this is not so, Fidel
stressed, it would be impossible to reach that level in rural areas.
