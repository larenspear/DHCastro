[Text] Rabat, 19 Dec--Cuban Prime Minister Fidel Castro today had breakfast
here with Moroccan King Hassan II, the Rabat press has reported.

The Cuban leader early this morning landed here on a technical stopover en
route to Moscow abroad an Aeroflot Ilyushin-62 plane.

Fidel Castro confirmed to the press that he had had breakfast with King
Hassan II, Prime Minister Ahmed Osman and with Foreign Minister Ahmed Taibi

Our talk--Castro said--was mainly devoted to agriculture, a topic for which
I have a special passion.

told him that he hoped to see him again during the stopover of his return
flight to Havana. Fidel Castro replied that he did not know when or how we

such a warm welcome.
