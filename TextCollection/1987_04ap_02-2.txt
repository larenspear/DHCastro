[Text] Presided over by our Commander in Chief, Fidel Castro, the debates
of the second day of the Fifth UJC Congress are under way at the Palace of
Conventions. The session began with collective congratulations to a number
of delegates who are celebrating their birthdays during the congress. A
representative from Ciego de Avila then read a humorous poem in honor of
Ramon Balmaceda, delegate from Sancti Spiritus, who yesterday held a lively
dialogue with Fidel.

Celia Conseca, UJC secretary general at the Laboratory Animals Supply
Center, said there was a big spirit of work and sacrifice to finish
building the Havana Work Center, which will be essential to biotechnology.
Francisco Escobedo, from the No 11 Industrial Works Enterprise in Santiago
de Cuba, referred to the huge projects the enterprise is involved in and
said that the work of young people is decisive.
