SIERRA MAESTRA TEACHERS RALLY NO. 6

CASTRO SPEECH (CONTINUED)

NEXT YEAR WILL BE "YEAR OF EDUCATION". OUR TARGET WILL BE TO ERADICATE
ILLITERACY. WE MUST MOBILIZE PEOPLE TO ACCOMPLISH THIS. WE WILL DO IT IN
ONE YEAR TO SHOW POWER OF REVOLUTION AND HOW IT REACHES OBJECTIVES. WE WILL
SET UP PRIZES FOR THOSE WHO TEACH MOST ILLITERATES. TOP WINNERS WILL BE
MADE "HEROES OF REVOLUTION". ALL O F US MUST PLAN HOW TO WAGE BATTLE OF
EDUCATION NEXT YEAR AND HOW TO WIN IT.

ANOTHER TASK YOU WILL HAVE IS TO SELECT BEST STUDENTS TO SEND TO SCHOOL
CENTERS. IN THIS WAY BEST STUDENTS WILL HAVE OPPORTUNITY FOR SECONDARY
SCHOOLING, AND BEST OF THESE WILL BE GIVEN OPPORTUNITY TO ATTEND
UNIVERSITY. THIS PLAN WILL GIVE HUMBLE CHILDREN WITH GOOD MINDS EQUAL
OPPORTUNITY.

ANOTHER FACTOR YOU MUST BEAR IN MIND IS TO LEAVE ENOUGH TIME FOR RURAL
CHILDREN TO ASSIST PARENTS IN WORK IN FIELDS AND HOME. YOU HAVE
RESPONSIBILITY FOR GENERAL ORIENTATION OF CHILDREN UNDER YOUR CARE.

DURING FIRST AND SECOND YEAR YOU WILL RECEIVE 100 PESOS A MONTH. AFTER THAT
IT WILL INCREASE IN ACCORDANCE PLANS OF MINISTER OF EDUCATION.  AT END OF 7
YEARS SALARY WILL REACH 200 PESOS MONTHLY.  NOT ALL OF YOU WILL GO TO
MOUNTAINS.  SOME ARE REQUIRED TO TEACH MILITIA YOUTH GROUPS AND REBEL ARMY.
SOME OF YOU WITH HIGHER EDUCATIONS WILL BE GIVEN SPECIAL REVOLUTIONARY
JOBS.  MOST OF YOU WILL PASS DIRECTLY TO JOIN RESPECTIVE SCHOOLS; OTHERS TO
OTHER JOBS,AND A FEW TO FURTHER TRAINING.

ALL OF US SHOULD STRIVE TO IMPROVE OURSELVES AND FUTURE GROUPS OF TEACHERS.
WE NEED TO REALIZE ONLY SOME TEACHERS CAN STAY IN CITIES AND OTHERS MUST GO
TO INTERIOR.  WE MUST CORRECT PAST ANOMALIES.  WE MUST MAKE NEW TEXTBOOKS
REFLECTING GREAT ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF REVOLUTION.

SUCCESSES OF RESOLUTION ARE INCREASINGLY EVIDENT.  CUBAN PEOPLE ARE UP TO
DEMANDS OF REVOLUTION.  THEIR ACCOMPLISHMENTS FIT NOT ONLY CUBA BUT OTHER
AREAS AS WELL.  MANY THINGS REMAIN TO BE DONE.  THESE WILL BE ACHIEVED IF
PEOPLE WORK TOWARD THEM. DREAMS CAN BE REALIZED.  WE CAN ELIMINATE
ILLITERACY, BUILD SCHOOLS, FACTORIES, ETC. AND MAKE CUBA GREAT COUNTRY.  WE
CAN CONTINUE BREAKING PRIVILEGES AND MAKING OURSELVES GREAT EXAMPLE OF
AMERICA; TERMINATING EXPLOITATION AND ACHIEVING GREATER PROGRESS.

THOSE WHO FOLLOW MISTAKE ROAD WILL ALWAYS BE MISTAKEN.  THIS IS ROAD
FOLLOWED BY YANKEE IMPERIALISM

(RYTHMIC CLAPPING AND SLOGAN CHANTING BEGINS.  CONTINUES 5 MINUTES WHEN
CASTRO ASKS NATIONAL ANTHEM BE PLAYED.)

(CASTRO HAS BEEN SPEAKING HOUR AND HALF).
