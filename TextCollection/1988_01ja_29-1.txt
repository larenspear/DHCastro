[Test] Commander in Chief Fidel Castro, first secretary of the PCC Central
Committee, has closed the fourth congress of the UNEAC, which took place at
Havana's Palace of conventions during the past 3 days.

Fidel said we must work closely with the new generations in order to have
people of great culture.  He also said the reason for existence of the
revolution and socialism is to elevate to the highest level man's abilities
and freedom, not only in type but in substance.

Carlos Aldana, secretary of the PCC Central Committee, said earlier that
this congress marks a phase in the life of the UNEAC as well as in the
scope of Cuban culture.  He also noted that the democratization of our
whole cultural life is necessary for its future development.
