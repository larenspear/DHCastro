Sofia Domestic Service in Bulgarian 1830 GMT 25 May 72 A

[Excerpt] At a luncheon given by the BCP Central Committee Politburo for
the Cuban party-government delegation in Sofia today, Tudor Zhivkov
delivered a speech conveying cordial greetings to Fidel Castro and all
Cuban comrades expressing appreciation for their visit to Bulgaria. He also
expressed great satisfaction with the successful talks between the two
parties and countries, between the Bulgarian and Cuban peoples.

In reply, Fidel Castro emphasized that the talks between the two
party-government delegations were very useful and significant. The broad
information exchange on economic and political problems opens additional
possibilities for greater cooperation. Our visit to Bulgaria has been very
useful and meaningful for us, he said, and that is why we are particularly
satisfied and will take with us excellent impressions.
