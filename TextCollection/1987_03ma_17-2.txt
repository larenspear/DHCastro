[Text] Commander in Chief Fidel Castro has met with Zimbabwean Foreign
Minister Witness Mangwende, who conducted an official and friendly meeting
to Cuba after participating in the special ministerial meeting of the
Nonaligned Movement in Guyana. Mangwende conveyed to Castro a greeting from
Zimbabwean Prime Minister Robert Mugabe, who is president of the Nonaligned
Movement. These were reciprocated.

During their talks, Castro and Mangwende discussed the situation in
southern Africa, reaffirming Cuba and Zimbabwe's determination to step up
the struggle against the apartheid regime. They agreed on the positive
trend in the region, where front line countries and national liberation
movements are confronting the racist South African regime more forcefully.
