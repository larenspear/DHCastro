FULL TEXT OF ARTICLE:
1.  [Text] The National Assembly of the People's Government [ANPP] has just
elected Comrade Juan Escalona Reguera as its president and Comrade Zoila
Benitez de Mendoza as vice president. The ANPP was summoned today for a special
meeting to fill the vacancy of the post of president, left open since the death
of Comrade Flavio Bravo Pardo.

2.  After approving Comrade Severo Aguirre del Cristo's request to be relieved
from the post of acting president because of his advanced age--he is 78 years
old--the 468 present deputies also voted to elect the vice president, who is
currently education director in Havana.

3.  I repeat, Juan Escalona Reguera and Zoila Benitez have just been elected
president and vice president, respectively, of the ANPP.
