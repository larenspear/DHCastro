[Text] Commander in Chief Fidel Castro has been in Santiago de Cuba
Province for 24 hours now.  He arrived yesterday in Contramaestre
municipality, where he inaugurated the modern Orlando Pantoja Hospital,
which he called a jewel.  The chief of the revolution already visited Palma
Soriano.  He inaugurated a liquid animal feed plant and a group of
livestock-agricultural projects which include 25 camps for youths of the
Youth Labor Army, 30 hydroponic fields, 454 houses for agricultural
workers, and a bull feeding center.

Fidel, always accompanied by Esteban Lazo, member of the PCC Politburo and
first secretary of the party in Santiago de Cuba, also toured the Palma
Soriano match factory, with experimental production, and the new hospitals
of San Luis and Julio Antonio Mella municipalities.  Early this morning,
the first secretary of the party also visited the hydroponic fields of
Santiago Fruit Enterprise, located on the outskirts of the city.  This
enterprise has allotted its first tomato production to the people of
Santiago.

At the time this newscast was being prepared, Fidel was touring the large
installations of the new Retomed medical equipment factory.  Its
production, together with the one in the capital, has already filled the
needs of family doctors offices, which are now almost all over the entire
province.
