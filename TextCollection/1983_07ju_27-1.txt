[Text] Havana July 27 TASS -- Fidel Castro, first secretary of the Central
Committee of the Communist Party of Cuba and chairman of the Council of
State and of the Council of Ministers of the Republic of Cuba, has
addressed a mass rally in the city of Santiago de Cuba on the occasion of
National Uprising Day -- the 30th anniversary since the storming of the
Moncada Barracks.

The Cuban leader declared that the triumph of the revolution, the way to
which had been cleared by the storming of the Moncada Barracks, crowned the
nearly age-old popular struggle for independence.  After pointing out the
Cuban people's big successes in building socialism, Fidel Castro noted that
they have been achieved in a situation where the Reagan administration has
been stepping up threats against the Freedom Island.  He expressed the
Cuban people's determination to issue a befitting rebuff to any imperialist
encroachment on the independence of their country.

Fidel Castro strongly condemned the U.S. policy of aggression in Central
America.  The United States, he said, is in fact even today involved in
intervention against Nicaragua and meddling impudently in the home affairs
of El Salvador.  After pointing out the dangerous nature of the arms race,
which is being whipped up by the Reagan administration, Castro describe the
U.S. decision to deploy new U.S. medium-range missiles in Western Europe as
an unprecedented provocation against socialist countries.
