(Text)  Caracas--Fidel Castro met Romulo Betancourt, President-elect of
Venezuela, near Caracas today.  Although no statement was issued on the
subjects discussed during the meeting, it is assumed that the two men
discussed a plant for mutual aid applicable in case of a
counterrevolution, and the possibilities of eliminating customs barriers
between Cuba and Venezuela.

Betancourt, who has been on a tour of the interior of the country since
last Saturday and who this morning was still in Maracay, 100 kilometers
from the capital, is reported to have received Fidel Castro on the estate
of a political friend, some 20 kilometers from Caracas.
