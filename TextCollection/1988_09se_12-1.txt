[Text]  More than 50,000 people in Havana participated yesterday in the
Race Against Time, which was run simultaneously in 124 countries.
Commander in Chief Fidel Castro fired the shot signaling the start of the
race at the Revolution Square.  This was the largest marathon ever held in
the country.  Pioneers, youths, and disabled and other people participated
in the event.  It was organized by the British philanthropic organization
Sports Aid to collect funds for poor children of the world.

Also yesterday, Fidel visited the Miguel Henriquez Hospital expansion
project and talked extensively with construction workers.  He announced
that the east-west highway being built by the Blas Roca Calderio contingent
will be ready for use in December.  The highway will have three lanes in
each direction.
