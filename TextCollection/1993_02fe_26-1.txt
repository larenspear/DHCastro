1.  [Interview with President Fidel Castro by Peter Brinkmann; place and date
not given: ``Fidel Castro: I Am A Slave of the Revolution'']

2.  [Excerpts] [Passage omitted on introductory paragraph on situation in
Cuba]

3.  [Brinkmann] What can Germany do for Cuba?

4.  [Castro] I hope the new, powerful Germany will increase its pressure on
America to end the embargo. Yet the new President, Clinton, is not Alexander
the Great, who could cut the Gordian knot of political relations between Cuba
and America with a sword. I have done many marathons for socialism. Yet I do
not want to remain a slave of the revolution forever. I am now 66. I hope
someone else will take over the baton of revolution within the next five
years. Still, people need me. We must complete the revolution.

5.  Say hello to Germany; the Germans are always welcome here. [passage
omitted]
