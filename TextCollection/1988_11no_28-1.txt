[Text]  Commander in Chief Fidel Castro Ruz, first secretary of the PCC
Central Committee and president of the Councils of State and Ministers of
Cuba, presented a banner today in Las Tunas to the Victoria de Playa Giron
contingent which is building the road to the northern beach of Cobarrubias.
The top leader of the revolution talked extensively with the 82 laborers
who are building a 20-km long road in a record time.

The new road will give access to the Cobarrubias Beach in Las Tunas.
International tourism is going to be developed here with the construction
of facilities for this purpose.  The commander in chief praised the
outstanding work of the construction workers and of the Las Tunas
contingent that built the 200 T rolling mill in only a little over 14
months.  This rolling mill will be inaugurated in the province's capital
during a huge event at 1700.
