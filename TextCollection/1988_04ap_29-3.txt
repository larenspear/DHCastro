[Excerpts] Commander in Chief Fidel Castro, president of the Councils of
State and Ministers, presided over the last session of the second national
meeting of the projects front.

The meeting was held today at Havana's Palace of Conventions.  Five hundred
delegates and guests representing all provinces of the country attended the
discussions of the three theses on saving of material, dedication to work
and aesthetics, and functional technical designs.

A main subject of the meeting was the relationship that must exist between
the planner and the investor in order to obtain more savings when projects
are carried out and to have a wider variety of projects.  [passage omitted]

[Begin Castro recording] What is, in my opinion, the ideal thing?  I am
convinced, I have thought about this a lot.  It is the combination of the
possibilities of a program and plan with the ability to give quick,
immediate answers.  But we cannot be misled by thinking that there is a
perfect plan because we can be misled even more.  I have asked, what
advantage is there to socialism and what advantage is there to capitalism?
It is clear that the greatest advantage that socialism has is the
possibility to plan development without clashing with many antagonistic
interests in the society, the possibility to plan development.  The
possibility to plan, to avoid anarchy and chaos is a great advantage of
socialism.  [end recording]
