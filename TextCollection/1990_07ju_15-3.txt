1.  [Text] Havana July 15 (CTK)--Cuban leader Fidel Castro last night described
all Cuban citizens who penetrated the Czechoslovak Embassy and the private flat
of the Czechoslovak charge d'affaires in Havana as ``anti-social elements who
were encouraged to their acts by Czechoslovak diplomats''.

2.  Speaking at a reception given by the French ambassador in Havana last night
on the occasion of the 201st anniversary of the French Revolution, Fidel Castro
stressed that ``the Czechoslovak diplomats in Havana now try to present the
situation as if the Cuban Government should solve it. In fact, the whole affair
is alien to Cuba and should be solved by the Czechoslovak side'', he said,
commenting on the situation for the first time.

3.  He added that the persons who sought refuge in the Czechoslovak Embassy
were not prosecuted for any criminal acts nor were they persecuted for
political reasons. Most of them, however, served numerous sentences earlier.

4.  Two of the 14 Cuban citizens left the premises of the embassy Friday [13
July] night, and there are now twelve Cubans left there but another five Cubans
are hiding at the residence of Czechoslovak Charge d'Affaires Jan Demek.
