[Text] Concerning the remarks made by a delegate to the Third Congress of
the Federation of University Students [FEU], Commander in Chief Fidel
Castro has pointed out that the privilege of being a student in Cuba
entails a moral duties whose disregard cannot be viewed with indifference.
In relation to cheating, he said that more forceful measures have to be
taken.

He stressed that the teachers have a great deal of blame and responsibility
in cheating because they should know their students and what their
potential is. It is impossible for every student to get excellent grades
overnight. Delegate Lenin Ortega spoke about the establishment of the
technical sciences detachment and its regulations, and stated that it
should be similar to the medical sciences detachment as far as rigorousness
in concerned.

The number of college majors and the importance that these respond to the
country's actual requirements were also discussed.
