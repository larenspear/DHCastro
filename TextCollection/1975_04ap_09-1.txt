Arrival in Cienfuegos

[Editorial Report FL] Cienfuegos Domestic Service in Spanish at 1408 GMT on
9 April 1975 broadcasts live from Jaime Gonzalez Airport the arrival of
Prime Minister Castro and Guyanese Prime Minister Forbes Burnham. It
reports that PCC Provincial First Secretary Arnaldo Milian Castro welcomes
the two chiefs of state, and at 1419 GMT the official motorcade leaves "for
downtown Cienfuegos and the Tricontinental Bulk Sugar Terminal." The radio
then switches to mobile units along the route for continued reporting on
the motorcade's progress. The broadcast at 1445 GMT returns to the main
studios for an announcement that Castro and Burnham will tour a fertilizer
plant and the bulk sugar terminal, and then address a Cuba-Guyana
friendship rally.
