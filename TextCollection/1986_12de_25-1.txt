[Text] The afternoon session of the first working day of the 11th ordinary
period of the second legislature of the National Assembly of the People's
Government [ANPP] opened with the resumption of the debate of the
Cienfuegos Assembly report. Moments before the morning session ended,
Commander in Chief Fidel Castro noted that there were many important issues
to examine before approving the Cienfuegos report. Among them, Fidel cited
the question of whether the oil refinery would be completed in 1988, the
efforts being made at the electronuclear plant, and the problem of the
Cienfuegos Bay oilspill.

A message was read from Luis Leon, president of the Latin American
parliament, in solidarity with Argentina's just claims over the sovereignty
of the Malvinas.
